Our mission is to be the preferred choice of personal storage solutions for the worldwide digital economy. We seek to achieve our mission by developing leading technologies and innovative products and delivering our products through both OEM and retail channels. We design, develop, market and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, controller, and firmware technologies. Our products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras, mobile phones, USB drives, gaming consoles, MP3 players and other digital devices. Our products are also embedded in a variety of systems for the enterprise, industrial, military and other markets. Flash storage technology allows data to be stored in a low power consumption, durable and compact format that retains the data after the power has been turned off. As a supplier to this industry, our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. We believe the market for flash storage has price elasticity of demand. We expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory. In order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products, we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer. We seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily focused on increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon. In January 2006, we acquired Matrix, a designer and developer of three dimensional (3 D) integrated circuits. Matrix 3 D Memory is used for one time programmable storage applications that complement our existing flash storage memory products. 38 Table of Contents Matrix 3 D Memory is used for storage applications that do not require rewriteable memory and where low cost is the paramount consideration, such as video games, music and other content, or for archiving. The acquisition of Matrix resulted in a $39.6 million write off of in process acquired technology during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In May 2006, we issued and sold $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the 1% Notes due 2013). The 1% Notes due 2013 were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1% per annum. The 1% Notes due 2013 may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.1426 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $82.36 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. The net proceeds to us from the offering of the 1% Notes due 2013 were $1.13 billion. Concurrently with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants. The separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013 and to increase the initial conversion price to $95.03 per share. Net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures for new and existing manufacturing facilities, development of new technologies, general working capital and other non manufacturing capital expenditures. The net proceeds may also be used to fund strategic investments or acquisitions of products, technologies or complementary businesses or obtain the right or license to use additional technologies. On July 7, 2006, we and Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, entered into a business venture, Flash Alliance, to build Fab 4, a new advanced 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations, to meet the anticipated growing demand for NAND flash memory in 2008 and beyond. We own 49.9% and Toshiba owns 50.1% of Flash Alliance. Both we and Toshiba will collaborate in the development and manufacture of NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products will be manufactured by Toshiba at Fab 4 using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by Flash Alliance. Flash Alliance will purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We account for our 49.9% ownership position in Flash Alliance under the equity method of accounting. We are committed to purchase half of Flash Alliances NAND wafer supply. See Toshiba Ventures. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payments, using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized on a straight line basis, in the year ended December 31, 2006 included the following: (a) compensation cost based on the grant date fair value related to any share based awards granted through, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and (b) compensation cost for any share based awards granted on or subsequent to January 2, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), we recognized share based compensation expense of $100.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, which affected our reported cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, at December 31, 2006, we capitalized to inventory $3.2 million of compensation cost for share based awards that were issued to manufacturing personnel. We calculate this share based compensation expense based on the fair values of the share based compensation awards as estimated using the Black Scholes Merton closed form option valuation model. As of December 31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements already granted under our various plans was $260.1 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.7 years. On November 19, 2006, we acquired msystems Ltd., or msystems. msystems designs, develops and markets innovative flash data storage solutions for digital consumer electronics markets. msystems primarily targets two digital consumer electronics markets: the mobile phone market and the USB flash drive market. msystems also sells flash data storage products targeted at the embedded systems market. The acquisition of msystems resulted in a $186.0 million write off of in process acquired technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. On November 30, 2006, we assumed through our acquisition of msystems, $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1% Convertible Notes due 2035, or the 1% Notes due 2035. The 1% Notes due 2035 pay interest at a rate of 1% per annum. The 1% Notes due 2035 may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 26.8302 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $37.27 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, income taxes, warranty obligations, stock compensation, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates have historically approximated actual results. However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs. We recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization. Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire. At December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, deferred income, from sales to distributors and retailers was $312.9 million and $139.9 million, respectively. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements. We record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co op advertising, and other volume based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, we have incentive programs that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not been significantly different from our estimates. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the net revenue we report. Inventories and Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors. Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months. To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Accounting for Investments. We evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R, or FIN 46R, Accounting for Variable Interest Entities. If those entities are variable interest entities, then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity. With respect to all equity investments, we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in. Generally, after considering all factors, if we hold equity interests representing less than 20% of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in, we use the cost method of accounting. If we hold at least 20% but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in, we use the equity method of accounting. We have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with Toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value. Changes in our intent could materially impact our financial statements. 40 Table of Contents Deferred Tax Assets. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $60.1 million and $14.9 million at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively, based on our view that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to take tax a benefit for certain net operating loss carryforwards, certain capitalized expenses and certain unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries. Share Based Compensation Employee Incentive Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Beginning on January 2, 2006, we began accounting for stock awards and ESPP shares under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payments, which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation. The fair value of stock awards and ESPP shares was estimated using a Black Scholes Merton closed form option valuation model. This model requires the input of assumptions in implementing SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility, expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis. We elected the modified prospective method for adoption of SFAS 123(R). We recognized compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures at a rate of 7.74%. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the APIC credit pool generated by previous share based excess tax benefits to determine if there are any tax deficiencies which require recognition in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Prior to the implementation of SFAS 123(R), we accounted for stock awards and ESPP shares under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, or SFAS 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amended Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a Black Scholes Merton closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated fair value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested. The fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Business Combinations. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, or SFAS 141, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales, customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents, expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, as well as assumptions about the expected life of the core technology and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product Revenues. Percent Percent FY 2006 Change FY 2005 Change FY 2004 (in millions, except percentages) Retail $ 1,975.4 22 % $ 1,621.0 31 % $ 1,236.0 OEM 951.0 113 % 445.6 21 % 366.8 Product revenues $ 2,926.4 42 % $ 2,066.6 29 % $ 1,602.8 The increase in our 2006 product revenues was comprised of a 246% increase in the number of megabytes sold, partially offset by a 59% reduction in our average selling price per megabyte. The markets that we sell to have experienced price elasticity of demand. In 2006, as the price per megabyte decreased, the average memory density of our products sold increased by 67%. Our unit sales also increased by 106% with the growth in our unit sales primarily attributable to growth in sales of cards for mobile phones and flash based digital audio players. OEM revenues particularly benefited from higher sales of mobile cards to mobile phone manufacturers, 3 D gaming cards and from our acquisition of msystems, which accounted for an additional $115 million of revenue. Retail revenue growth benefited primarily from higher sales of mobile cards, flash based digital audio players and USB flash drives. We expect to continue to reduce our price per megabyte, including price reductions already initiated in 2007, as a result of competitive pressures, industry supply and demand, as well as technology advances. The increase in our 2005 product revenues consisted of a 166% increase in the number of megabytes sold and partially offset by a 52% reduction in our average selling price per megabyte. In 2005, as the price per megabyte came down, the average memory density of our products sold increased by 115%. Our unit sales also increased by 23% with the growth in our unit sales primarily attributable to growth in the markets for mobile cards for camera phones and music centric phones, USB flash drives and flash based digital audio players. Partially offsetting the 2005 growth in revenues was the fact that fiscal 2005 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in the prior year. Geographical Product Revenues.

Revenue from other foreign countries, which is primarily Asia, increased the most, primarily reflecting increased sales to mobile phone manufacturers and their related contract manufacturers. Sales in Japan increased primarily from higher sales of 3 D gaming cards from our acquisition of Matrix. The increase in sales in North America was due primarily to sales of our flash based digital audio players, sales of cards for mobile phones and USB drives. In 2005, our revenue from Japan primarily reflects the reduction in the sales of flash memory cards to digital camera OEMs based in Japan to the transition of after market sales of flash memory cards primarily in North America and EMEA. 43 Table of Contents License and Royalty Revenues. FY 2006 Percent Change FY 2005 Percent Change FY 2004 (in millions, except percentages) License and royalty revenues $ 331.1 38 % $ 239.5 37 % $ 174.2 The increase in our 2006 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees. The increase in our 2005 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees. Gross Margins. FY 2006 Percent Change FY 2005 Percent Change FY 2004 (in millions, except percentages) Product gross margins $ 908.4 24 % $ 733.3 43 % $ 511.5 Product gross margins (as a percent of product revenue) 31.0 % 35.5 % 31.9 % Total gross margins (as a percent of total revenue) 38.0 % 42.2 % 38.6 % The 2006 product gross margin decreased from 2005 to 2006 by 4.5 percentage points. Approximately 2.9 percentage points of the gross margin decline was due to average selling prices declining at a faster rate than our product cost. In addition, our margins were negatively impacted by approximately 0.8% due to the acquisition of msystems, whose business in the fourth quarter was primarily based on non captive memory supply. In addition, cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $27.8 million and share based compensation expense related to implementation of FAS 123(R) of $8.0 million, which combined accounted for approximately 0.8% of the decrease in the product gross margins over 2005. The largest driver of the 2005 increase in product gross margins was the reduction in our cost per megabyte due to the transition to 90 nanometer technology partially offset by decreases in our average selling price per megabyte. Fiscal 2005 gross margins were also benefited due to more production supply coming from captive sources which have lower costs. Research and Development. FY 2006 Percent Change FY 2005 Percent Change FY 2004 (in millions, except percentages) Research and development $ 306.9 58 % $ 194.8 56 % $ 125.0 Percent of revenue 9.4 % 8.4 % 7.0 % Our 2006 research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll, payroll related expenses and facility related expenses of approximately $57 million associated with headcount growth. Share based compensation expense related to implementation of FAS 123(R) accounted for $41.0 million of the research and development expense growth. In addition, research and development expense growth included initial design and development of 56 nanometer technology. Our 2005 research and development expense growth was primarily due to higher vendor engineering costs and costs associated with the initial design and development of manufacturing process technology related to Flash Partners 300 millimeter production line of $42.4 million, and payroll and payroll related expenses of $15.6 million associated with headcount increases related to developing new products. 44 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing.

The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values. As of December 31, 2006, it was estimated that these in process projects would be completed over the next one to three years at an estimated total cost of approximately $27 million.

See Note 7, Financing Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Other income for 2005 was comprised of interest income of $42.8 million, an other than temporary reduction in the value of our investment in Tower of ($10.1) million and other items of $4.0 million. Provision for Income Taxes. FY 2006 FY 2005 FY 2004 Provision for Income Taxes 53.5 % 37.0 % 37.0 % Our fiscal 2006 tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state tax expense, net of federal benefit, nondeductible stock option compensation adjustments recorded under FAS 123(R), in process RD write offs, tax exempt interest income and foreign income at other than U.S. tax rates. The 2006 tax rate increased over prior year primarily due to nondeductible stock option compensation adjustments recorded under FAS 123(R), in process RD write offs, partially offset by increases in tax exempt interest income and foreign income at other than U.S. tax rates. Our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to state tax expense, net of federal benefit. Our future tax rate may be impacted by state taxes, our ability to realize tax benefits from capital losses, our ability to obtain tax concessions from certain tax jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our earnings. 46 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows. Operating activities generated $598.1 million of cash during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 were: (1) net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share based compensation and write off of acquired in process technology, which were partially offset by lower deferred taxes and gain on investment in foundries, and (2) increases in accounts payable to related parties and other liabilities, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivables, inventory and other assets and decreases in accounts payable trade. Operating activities generated $480.9 million of cash during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006. Significant contributors to the generation of cash from operations were net income of $386.4 million, non cash adjustments to income for depreciation and amortization of $65.8 million, loss on investment in Tower of $10.1 million, foreign currency revaluation of FlashVision notes receivable of $7.7 million, amortization/accretion related to original premium/discount on short term investments of $2.6 million, decreases in income tax receivable of $64.2 million, increases in accounts payable of $148.2 million, increases in related party liabilities of $24.7 million, accrued payroll and related expenses of $13.8 million, deferred income of $57.2 million and current and non current other accrued liabilities of $6.9 million. These were partially offset by increases in the inventory balance of $135.2 million, accounts receivable of $134.2 million, other current and non current assets of $31.1 million, wafer cost adjustments of $2.3 million and deferred taxes of $1.5 million. We used $978.1 million for investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Purchases of short and long term investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments, totaled $638.9 million. Capital expenditures totaling $176.5 million and investments and notes to the flash ventures of $204.1 million, net of repayments was partially offset by cash acquired of $51.8 million as a result of our acquisition of Matrix and msystems. We used $299.5 million for investing activities during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006. We increased our short term investment balance by $81.0 million, loaned $34.2 million to FlashVision, invested $21.8 million in Flash Partners, loaned $20.0 million to Matrix, purchased $39.1 million of semiconductor wafer manufacturing equipment to be used at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations, purchased $95.4 million of test equipment and $3.5 million of investment in foundries and acquired a technology license for $4.5 million. We generated $1.20 billion of cash from financing activities due to $1.13 billion of cash from the issuance of the 1% Convertible Senior Notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the purchase of the convertible bond hedge of $386.1 million. We received $308.7 million from the issuance of warrants and $96.3 million from exercises of share based awards. Additionally, we received a tax benefit of $61.5 million on employee stock programs during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. We generated $115.4 million of cash from exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006. Liquid Assets. At December 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $2.81 billion. Short Term Liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, our working capital balance was $3.3 billion. We do not expect any liquidity constraints over the next twelve months. We currently expect our total investments, loans, expenditures and guarantees over the next 12 months to be approximately $1.4 billion. Of this amount, we expect to loan, make investments or guarantee future operating leases for fab expansion of approximately $1.1 billion and expect to spend approximately $300 million on property and equipment. The additions for property and equipment includes assembly, test and engineering equipment, information systems as well as equipment and the continued construction of a captive assembly and test manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China. The anticipated expenditure for this China project over the next 12 months is approximately $150 million of the total property and equipment expenditure and is subject to approval by the Chinese government. In December 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we intend to acquire up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years. Under this program, share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at our discretion. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular amount of shares and the plan may be suspended at our discretion. As of February 15, 2007, we have repurchased $0.4 million of shares. 47 Table of Contents On February 15, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan, or Plan, to reduce operating costs, which includes a worldwide reduction in force of up to 10% of our headcount, or approximately 250 employees. We expect to incur a restructuring charge in connection with the Plan in the range of $15 million to $20 million, with the majority of the expense occurring in the first quarter of 2007. Cash payments associated with the Plan will be approximately half of the total restructuring charge, with the remainder comprised of share based compensation charges resulting primarily from acceleration of certain equity awards as per terms of the msystems acquisition. The workforce reduction will impact functions related to operations, engineering, sales and marketing and administration and will primarily be based in the United States and Israel, and to a lesser degree, other international locations. The Plan is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Total annualized operating cash cost savings related to the reduction in force and other cost saving measures, excluding severance costs, are expected to be approximately $30 million to $35 million, including cash savings from the reduction in force of approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition, the reduction in force is expected to result in a decrease in share based compensation expense of approximately $10 million on an annualized basis. Long Term Requirements. Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future. We may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions. These additional investments or acquisitions may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from funding the ventures with Toshiba, increasing our wafer supply, developing or enhancing our products, taking advantage of future opportunities, growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes, any of which could harm our business. Financing Arrangements. In May 2006, we issued and sold $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1% Notes due 2013. The 1% Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1% per annum. The 1% Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.1426 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $82.36 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. The net proceeds to us from the offering of the 1% Notes were $1.13 billion. Concurrently with the issuance of the 1% Notes, we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants. The separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 1% Notes and to increase the initial conversion price to $95.03 per share. Each of these components are discussed separately below: Convertible Bond Hedge. Counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Notes in full, at a price of $82.36 per share. The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Notes or the first day none of the 1% Notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1% Notes. Should there be an early unwind of the convertible bond hedge transaction, the number of net shares potentially received by us will depend upon 1) the then existing overall market conditions, 2) our stock price, 3) the volatility of our stock, and 4) the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible bond hedge. The convertible bond hedge transaction cost of $386.1 million has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 19, or EITF 00 19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Statements Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. We recorded a tax benefit of approximately $145.6 million in stockholders equity from the deferred tax assets related to the convertible bond hedge. Sold Warrants. We received $308.7 million from the same counterparties from the sale of warrants to purchase up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share. As of December 31, 2006, the warrants have an expected life of approximately 6.5 years and expire in August 2013. At expiration, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis. As December 31, 2006, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding. The value of the warrants has been classified as equity because they meet all the equity classification criteria of EITF 00 19. On November 30, 2006, we assumed through our acquisition of msystems, their $75 million in aggregate principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, or the 1% Notes due 2035. The 1% Notes due 2035, pay interest at a rate of 1% per 48 Table of Contents annum. The 1% Notes due 2035 may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 26.8302 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $37.27 per share). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Toshiba Ventures. We are a 49.9% percent owner in, FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products. These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by FlashVision or Flash Partners or to be owned or leased by Flash Alliance. This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the ventures from us and Toshiba. FlashVision and Flash Partners purchase and Flash Alliance will purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. We are contractually obligated to purchase half of FlashVisions, Flash Partners and, when operational, Flash Alliances NAND wafer supply. We cannot estimate the total amount of our wafer purchase commitment as of December 31, 2006 because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers. In addition to the semiconductor assets owned or leased by FlashVision and Flash Partners, we directly own certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations from which we receive 100% of the output. From time to time, we and Toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of Flash Partners that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding. Our direct research and development contribution is based on a variable computation. We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory. We account for our 49.9% ownership position in the flash ventures under the equity method of accounting. Toshiba owns 50.1% of each of these ventures. The cost of the wafers we purchase from FlashVision and Flash Partners and wafers we will purchase from Flash Alliance is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales. FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance are variable interest entities and we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of any residual gains and are obligated with respect to less than a majority of residual losses with respect to each venture. Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate. Our share of the net income or loss of FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance is included in our Consolidated Statements of Income as Equity in income of business ventures. Under the FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities. As of December 31, 2006, we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of $5.9 million. Our common research and development obligation related to FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance is variable but capped at increasing fixed quarterly amounts through 2008. The common research and development participation agreement and the product development agreement are exhibits to this report on Form 10 K and should be read carefully in their entirety for a more complete understanding of these arrangements. For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by FlashVision or Flash Partners, we and or Toshiba guaranteed, in whole or in part, a portion of the outstanding lease payments under each of those leases through various methods. These obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are non cancelable. Under the terms of the FlashVision lease, Toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of FlashVision and we agreed to indemnify Toshiba for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of its guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation, which reflects payments and any lease adjustments, was approximately 5.8 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $49 million based upon the exchange rate at December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the Flash Partners leases, we guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis 50% of Flash Partners lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into in December 2004, December 2005 and June 2006. Our total lease obligation guarantee, net of lease payments as of December 31, 2006, were 72.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $605 million based upon the exchange rate at December 31, 2006. The Flash Alliance venture was formed to develop and design NAND flash memory products and is expected to sell these products using semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be owned or leased by Flash Alliance. The NAND flash memory products will be manufactured by Toshiba at the proposed 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 4, being built in Yokkaichi, Japan. Flash Alliance will purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup. Toshiba owns 50.1% of this venture and we own 49.9% of this venture. We are committed to purchase half of Flash Alliances NAND wafer supply. The capacity of Fab 4 at full expansion is expected to be greater than 150,000 wafers per month and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed by the parties. To date, the parties have agreed to an expansion plan to 67,500 wafers per month for which the total investment in Fab 4 is currently estimated at approximately $2.0 billion 49 Table of Contents through the end of fiscal year 2008, of which our share is currently estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion. Initial NAND production at Fab 4 is currently scheduled for the end of fiscal year 2007. For expansion beyond 67,500 wafers per month, it is expected that investments and output would continue to be shared 50/50 between us and Toshiba. We are committed to fund 49.9% of Flash Alliances costs to the extent that Flash Alliances revenues from wafer sales to us and Toshiba are insufficient to cover these costs. We expect to fund our portion of the investment through cash as well as other financing sources. We assumed msystems ownership interest in the venture with Toshiba, TwinSys, which was designed to enable the parties to benefit from a portion of each partys respective sales of USB flash drives. As of December 31, 2006, we had a 50.1% beneficial ownership in Twinsys Data Storage L.P., consisting of (i) 49.9% ownership in TwinSys and (ii) 0.2% interest held by Twinsys Ltd., in which we have a 51% ownership interest. We concluded that the venture is a variable interest entity as defined in FIN 46R, and determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the venture, and accordingly, we consolidate the venture. On a routine basis, the parties collectively prepare a joint production forecast for each companys respective needs. We and Toshiba are currently negotiating the mutual closure of this venture by the first half of fiscal year 2007; however, no written agreement has been reached. 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2006, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years is presented in textual and tabular format in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Impact of Currency Exchange Rates Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2006 and 2005, we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies than the U.S. dollar, currently only the Japanese yen. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) or accumulated other income. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. For a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments, consisting primarily of investment grade securities, substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $4.5 million decline (less than 0.25%) in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities. Foreign Currency Risk. A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do enter into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen. Movements in currency exchange rates, especially the Japanese yen, could cause variability in our revenues, expenses or other income (expense), net. We had forward exchange contracts in place with a notional amount of 8.6 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $72 million based upon the exchange rate at December 31, 2006 and approximately $34 million as of January 1, 2006. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate $8 million loss. However, as we utilize foreign currency instruments, for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure. See Item 1A, Risk Factors and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Market Risk. We also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies. As of December 31, 2006, a reduction in prices of 10% of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately $9 million. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at December 31, 2006. Actual results may differ materially. 52 Table of Contents
