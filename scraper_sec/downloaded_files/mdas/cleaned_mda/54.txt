minority interest net income general we are one of the worlds largest suppliers of nand flash based data storage products for the consumer mobile communications and industrial markets our mission is to be the preferred choice of personal storage solutions for the worldwide digital economy we seek to achieve our mission by developing leading technologies and innovative products and delivering our products through both oem and retail channels we design develop market and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory controller and firmware technologies our products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras mobile phones usb drives gaming consoles mp players and other digital devices our products are also embedded in a variety of systems for the enterprise industrial military and other markets flash storage technology allows data to be stored in a low power consumption durable and compact format that retains the data after the power has been turned off as a supplier to this industry our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products we believe the market for flash storage has price elasticity of demand we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily focused on increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon in january we acquired matrix a designer and developer of three dimensional d integrated circuits matrix d memory is used for one time programmable storage applications that complement our existing flash storage memory products table of contents matrix d memory is used for storage applications that do not require rewriteable memory and where low cost is the paramount consideration such as video games music and other content or for archiving the acquisition of matrix resulted in a million write off of in process acquired technology during the first quarter of fiscal in may we issued and sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes due the notes due were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of per annum the notes due may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest the net proceeds to us from the offering of the notes due were billion concurrently with the issuance of the notes due we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants the separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes due and to increase the initial conversion price to per share net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures for new and existing manufacturing facilities development of new technologies general working capital and other non manufacturing capital expenditures the net proceeds may also be used to fund strategic investments or acquisitions of products technologies or complementary businesses or obtain the right or license to use additional technologies on july we and toshiba corporation or toshiba entered into a business venture flash alliance to build fab a new advanced millimeter wafer fabrication facility at toshibas yokkaichi japan operations to meet the anticipated growing demand for nand flash memory in and beyond we own and toshiba owns of flash alliance both we and toshiba will collaborate in the development and manufacture of nand flash memory products these nand flash memory products will be manufactured by toshiba at fab using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash alliance flash alliance will purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we account for our ownership position in flash alliance under the equity method of accounting we are committed to purchase half of flash alliances nand wafer supply see toshiba ventures beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no r or sfas r share based payments using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation cost recognized on a straight line basis in the year ended december included the following a compensation cost based on the grant date fair value related to any share based awards granted through but not yet vested as of january and b compensation cost for any share based awards granted on or subsequent to january based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r as a result of adopting sfas r we recognized share based compensation expense of million during the year ended december which affected our reported cost of sales research and development selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses in addition at december we capitalized to inventory million of compensation cost for share based awards that were issued to manufacturing personnel we calculate this share based compensation expense based on the fair values of the share based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes merton closed form option valuation model as of december total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements already granted under our various plans was million which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years on november we acquired msystems ltd or msystems msystems designs develops and markets innovative flash data storage solutions for digital consumer electronics markets msystems primarily targets two digital consumer electronics markets the mobile phone market and the usb flash drive market msystems also sells flash data storage products targeted at the embedded systems market the acquisition of msystems resulted in a million write off of in process acquired technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal on november we assumed through our acquisition of msystems million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due or the notes due the notes due pay interest at a rate of per annum the notes due may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including among others those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories and related reserves investments income taxes warranty obligations stock compensation contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources estimates have historically approximated actual results however future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete as evidenced by an agreement with the customer transfer of title and acceptance if applicable fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and therefore the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer or the rights of return expire at december and january deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million respectively estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings including price protection promotions co op advertising and other volume based incentives and expected returns additionally we have incentive programs that require us to estimate based on historical experience the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues in the past actual returns and rebates have not been significantly different from our estimates however actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates which could impact the net revenue we report inventories and inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in first out or market market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes industry trends existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors should actual market conditions differ from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally six to twelve months to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders we could be required to record additional inventory reserves which would have a negative impact on our gross margin accounting for investments we evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no r or fin r accounting for variable interest entities if those entities are variable interest entities then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity with respect to all equity investments we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in generally after considering all factors if we hold equity interests representing less than of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in we use the cost method of accounting if we hold at least but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in we use the equity method of accounting we have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value changes in our intent could materially impact our financial statements table of contents deferred tax assets we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets we consider historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of million and million at december and january respectively based on our view that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to take tax a benefit for certain net operating loss carryforwards certain capitalized expenses and certain unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries share based compensation employee incentive plans and employee stock purchase plans beginning on january we began accounting for stock awards and espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no r or sfas r share based payments which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation the fair value of stock awards and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes merton closed form option valuation model this model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r including expected stock price volatility expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award the parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis we elected the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r we recognized compensation expense for the fair values of these awards which have graded vesting on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards net of estimated forfeitures at a rate of we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the apic credit pool generated by previous share based excess tax benefits to determine if there are any tax deficiencies which require recognition in the condensed consolidated statements of income prior to the implementation of sfas r we accounted for stock awards and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no or sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which amended statement of financial accounting standards no accounting for stock based compensation pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a black scholes merton closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated fair value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant business combinations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no or sfas business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed as well as assumptions about the expected life of the core technology and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results table of contents results of operations product revenues percent percent fy change fy change fy in millions except percentages retail oem product revenues the increase in our product revenues was comprised of a increase in the number of megabytes sold partially offset by a reduction in our average selling price per megabyte the markets that we sell to have experienced price elasticity of demand in as the

gross margins fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions except percentages product gross margins product gross margins as a percent of product revenue total gross margins as a percent of total revenue the product gross margin decreased from to by percentage points approximately percentage points of the gross margin decline was due to average selling prices declining at a faster rate than our product cost in addition our margins were negatively impacted by approximately due to the acquisition of msystems whose business in the fourth quarter was primarily based on non captive memory supply in addition cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of million and share based compensation expense related to implementation of fas r of million which combined accounted for approximately of the decrease in the product gross margins over the largest driver of the increase in product gross margins was the reduction in our cost per megabyte due to the transition to nanometer technology partially offset by decreases in our average selling price per megabyte fiscal gross margins were also benefited due to more production supply coming from captive sources which have lower costs research and development fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions except percentages research and development percent of revenue our

of december our working capital balance was billion we do not expect any liquidity constraints over the next twelve months we currently expect our total investments loans expenditures and guarantees over the next months to be approximately billion of this amount we expect to loan make investments or guarantee future operating leases for fab expansion of approximately billion and expect to spend approximately million on property and equipment the additions for property and equipment includes assembly test and engineering equipment information systems as well as equipment and the continued construction of a captive assembly and test manufacturing facility in shanghai china the anticipated expenditure for this china project over the next months is approximately million of the total property and equipment expenditure and is subject to approval by the chinese government in december we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we intend to acquire up to million of our outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years under this program share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at our discretion the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular amount of shares and the plan may be suspended at our discretion as of february we have repurchased million of shares table of contents on february our board of directors approved a plan or plan to reduce operating costs which includes a worldwide reduction in force of up to of our headcount or approximately employees we expect to incur a restructuring charge in connection with the plan in the range of million to million with the majority of the expense occurring in the first quarter of cash payments associated with the plan will be approximately half of the total restructuring charge with the remainder comprised of share based compensation charges resulting primarily from acceleration of certain equity awards as per terms of the msystems acquisition the workforce reduction will impact functions related to operations engineering sales and marketing and administration and will primarily be based in the united states and israel and to a lesser degree other international locations the plan is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal total annualized operating cash cost savings related to the reduction in force and other cost saving measures excluding severance costs are expected to be approximately million to million including cash savings from the reduction in force of approximately million to million in addition the reduction in force is expected to result in a decrease in share based compensation expense of approximately million on an annualized basis long term requirements depending on the demand for our products we may decide to make additional investments which could be substantial in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions these additional investments or acquisitions may require us to raise additional financing which could be difficult to obtain and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from funding the ventures with toshiba increasing our wafer supply developing or enhancing our products taking advantage of future opportunities growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes any of which could harm our business financing arrangements in may we issued and sold billion in aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of per annum the notes may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on an initial conversion rate of shares per principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest the net proceeds to us from the offering of the notes were billion concurrently with the issuance of the notes we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants the separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes and to increase the initial conversion price to per share each of these components are discussed separately below convertible bond hedge counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes in full at a price of per share the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day none of the notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the notes should there be an early unwind of the convertible bond hedge transaction the number of net shares potentially received by us will depend upon the then existing overall market conditions our stock price the volatility of our stock and the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible bond hedge the convertible bond hedge transaction cost of million has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with emerging issues task force no or eitf accounting for derivative financial statements indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million in stockholders equity from the deferred tax assets related to the convertible bond hedge sold warrants we received million from the same counterparties from the sale of warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share as of december the warrants have an expected life of approximately years and expire in august at expiration we may at our option elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis as december the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding the value of the warrants has been classified as equity because they meet all the equity classification criteria of eitf on november we assumed through our

flash partners and flash alliance our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshibas yokkaichi japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flashvision or flash partners or to be owned or leased by flash alliance this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the ventures from us and toshiba flashvision and flash partners purchase and flash alliance will purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flashvisions flash partners and when operational flash alliances nand wafer supply we cannot estimate the total amount of our wafer purchase commitment as of december because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers in addition to the semiconductor assets owned or leased by flashvision and flash partners we directly own certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in toshibas yokkaichi japan operations from which we receive of the output from time to time we and toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of flash partners that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding our direct research and development contribution is based on a variable computation we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory we account for our ownership position in the flash ventures under the equity method of accounting toshiba owns of each of these ventures the cost of the wafers we purchase from flashvision and flash partners and wafers we will purchase from flash alliance is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales flashvision flash partners and flash alliance are variable interest entities and we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of any residual gains and are obligated with respect to less than a majority of residual losses with respect to each venture accordingly we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate our share of the net income or loss of flashvision flash partners and flash alliance is included in our consolidated statements of income as equity in income of business ventures under the flashvision flash partners and flash alliance agreements we agreed to share in toshibas costs associated with nand product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities as of december we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of million our common research and development obligation related to flashvision flash partners and flash alliance is variable but capped at increasing fixed quarterly amounts through the common research and development participation agreement and the product development agreement are exhibits to this report on form k and should be read carefully in their entirety for a more complete understanding of these arrangements for semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flashvision or flash partners we and or toshiba guaranteed in whole or in part a portion of the outstanding lease payments under each of those leases through various methods these obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are non cancelable under the terms of the flashvision lease toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of flashvision and we agreed to indemnify toshiba for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of its guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement as of december the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation which reflects payments and any lease adjustments was approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december under the terms of the flash partners leases we guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis of flash partners lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into in december december and june our total lease obligation guarantee net of lease payments as of december were billion japanese yen or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december the flash alliance venture was formed to develop and design nand flash memory products and is expected to sell these products using semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be owned or leased by flash alliance the nand flash memory products will be manufactured by toshiba at the proposed millimeter wafer fabrication facility fab being built in yokkaichi japan flash alliance will purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup toshiba owns of this venture and we own of this venture we are committed to purchase half of flash alliances nand wafer supply the capacity of fab at full expansion is expected to be greater than wafers per month and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed by the parties to date the parties have agreed to an expansion plan to wafers per month for which the total investment in fab is currently estimated at approximately billion table of contents through the end of fiscal year of which our share is currently estimated to be approximately billion initial nand production at fab is currently scheduled for the end of fiscal year for expansion beyond wafers per month it is expected that investments and output would continue to be shared between us and toshiba we are committed to fund of flash alliances costs to the extent that flash alliances revenues from wafer sales to us and toshiba are insufficient to cover these costs we expect to fund our portion of the investment through cash as well as other financing sources we assumed msystems ownership interest in the venture with toshiba twinsys which was designed to enable the parties to benefit from a portion of each partys respective sales of usb flash drives as of december we had a beneficial ownership in twinsys data storage lp consisting of i ownership in twinsys and ii interest held by twinsys ltd in which we have a ownership interest we concluded that the venture is a variable interest entity as defined in fin r and determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the venture and accordingly we consolidate the venture on a routine basis the parties collectively prepare a joint production forecast for each companys respective needs we and toshiba are currently negotiating the mutual closure of this venture by the first half of fiscal year however no written agreement has been reached table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years is presented in textual and tabular format in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report impact of currency exchange rates future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in and we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies than the us dollar currently only the japanese yen we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense or accumulated other income see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks see item a risk factors table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments consisting primarily of investment grade securities substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments as of december a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities foreign currency risk a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in us dollars however we do enter into transactions in other currencies primarily the japanese yen movements in currency exchange rates especially the japanese yen
