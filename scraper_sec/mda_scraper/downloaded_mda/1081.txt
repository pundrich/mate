Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Products and Segments Lexmark makes it easier for businesses and consumers to move information between the digital and paper worlds. Since its inception in 1991, Lexmark has become a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of printing and imaging solutions for offices and homes. Lexmarks products include laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction devices, and associated supplies, services and solutions. Lexmark also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms by business users and develops, manufactures and markets a line of other office imaging products. The Company is primarily managed along Business and Consumer market segments: The Business market segment primarily sells laser products and primarily serves business customers, but also include consumers who choose laser products. Laser products can be divided into two major categories shared workgroup products and lower priced desktop products. Lexmark employs large account sales and marketing teams, closely supported by its development and product marketing teams, to generate demand for its business printing solutions and services. The sales and marketing teams primarily focus on customers who fall into six specific industry groups: finance, services, retail, manufacturing, public sector and health care. Lexmark also markets its laser and inkjet products increasingly through SMB teams who work closely with channel partners. The Company distributes and fulfills its laser products primarily through its well established distributor and reseller network. Lexmarks products are also sold through solution providers, which offer custom solutions to specific markets, and through direct response resellers. The Consumer market segment predominantly sells inkjet products to consumers but also includes business users who may choose inkjet products as a lower priced alternative or supplement to laser products for personal desktop use. For the consumer market, Lexmark distributes its branded inkjet products and supplies primarily through retail outlets worldwide. The Company also sells its products through numerous alliances and OEM arrangements. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Companys reportable segments, which is incorporated herein by reference. Operating Results Summary To improve profitability and the Companys cost and expense structure, Lexmark announced a number of actions in January 2006 that were implemented during the year: The Company implemented a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales. The Company announced a plan to restructure its workforce, consolidate some manufacturing capacity and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans. In 2006, Lexmark continued to make progress on its core strategic initiatives in both product segment expansion and brand development resulting in new product introductions. In 2006, the Company also experienced branded unit growth in its key focus segments with strong growth in low end monochrome lasers, color lasers, laser MFPs and inkjet AIOs. 25 Table of Contents Additionally, in late 2006, Lexmark launched the next step in its brand development initiative with the start of a new advertising campaign which the Company will continue in 2007 as Lexmarks focus in 2007 will be to drive branded unit growth in its key growth segments. Refer to the section entitled RESULTS OF OPERATIONS that follows for a further discussion of the Companys results of operations. Trends and Opportunities Lexmark management believes that the total distributed office and home printing output opportunity was approximately $90 billion in 2006, including hardware, supplies and related services. This opportunity includes printers and multifunction devices as well as a declining base of copiers and fax machines that are increasingly being integrated into multifunction devices. Based on industry analyst information, Lexmark management estimates that this market will grow annually at low to mid single digit percentage rates through 2010. Market trends driving long term growth include: Continuing improvement in price/performance points; Continued convergence in technology between printers, scanners, copiers and fax machines into single, integrated AIO devices; Advancements in digital photography driving the opportunity to print digital images on distributed output devices; Increased adoption of color output in business; and Advancements in electronic movement of information, driving more pages to be printed by end users when and where it is convenient to do so. As a result of these market trends, Lexmark has growth opportunities in low end monochrome laser printers, color lasers, laser MFPs and inkjet AIOs. Industry laser printer unit growth in recent years has generally exceeded the growth rate of laser printer revenue due to unit growth in lower priced desktop color and monochrome laser printers and unit price reductions. Additionally, color and multifunction laser printer units represent a more significant component of laser unit growth. Management believes these trends will continue. This pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers in the shared workgroup laser market to add higher profit margin optional features. Pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers. In the inkjet product market, advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices. Additionally, over the past couple years, the number of consumers seeking productivity related features has driven significant growth in AIO products. Key factors promoting this trend are greater affordability of AIOs containing productivity features like full fax capabilities and automatic document feeders. Management believes the combination of business features made for the home, as well as full photo capabilities, will continue to drive AIO growth. Growth in inkjet product revenue on an industry basis in recent years has been slower than unit growth due to price reductions. Management expects these trends to continue. While profit margins on printers and MFPs have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure, supplies sales are higher margin and recurring. However, as the hardcopy industry matures and printer and copier markets converge, management expects competitive pressures to continue. Lexmarks dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for IBM branded printers, aftermarket supplies for certain competitors products and typewriter supplies that require little ongoing investment. The Company expects that the market for these products 26 Table of Contents will continue to decline, and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit. Challenges and Risks In recent years, Lexmark and its principal competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and or technological resources than the Company, have regularly lowered prices on printers and are expected to continue to do so. Other challenges and risks faced by Lexmark include: New product announcements by the Companys principal competitors can have, and in the past, have had, a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. With the convergence of traditional printer and copier markets, major laser competitors now include traditional copier companies. The Company must compete with its larger competitors for retail shelf space allocated to printers and their associated supplies. The Company sees the possibility that new entrants into the market could also impact the Companys growth and market share. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant supplies pricing pressure, but if supplies pricing was to come under significant pressure, the Companys financial results could be materially adversely affected. Refill, remanufactured, clones, counterfeits and other compatible alternatives for some of the Companys cartridges are available and compete with the Companys supplies business. As the installed base of laser and inkjet products grows and matures, the Company expects competitive supplies activity to increase. Lexmark expects that as it competes with larger competitors, the Companys increased market presence may attract more frequent challenges, both legal and commercial, including claims of possible intellectual property infringement. The market for other office imaging products is also highly competitive and the impact printing sector of the supplies market is declining. Refer to the section entitled Competition in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of major uncertainties faced by the industry and Company. Additionally, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of factors that could impact the Companys operating results. Strategy and Initiatives Lexmarks strategy is based on a business model of investing in technology to develop and sell printing solutions, including printers and MFPs, with the objective of growing its installed base, which drives recurring supplies sales. Management believes that Lexmark has the following strengths related to this business model: Lexmark is exclusively focused on distributed home and office network or desktop computer printing and imaging, and related solutions. Lexmark internally develops all three of the key technologies in distributed printing, including inkjet, monochrome laser and color laser. Lexmark has leveraged its technological capabilities and its commitment to flexibility and responsiveness to build strong relationships with large account customers and channel partners. 27 Table of Contents Lexmarks strategy involves the following core strategic initiatives: Expand the number and the penetration of the product segments in which the Company participates; Expand the penetration of the market segments in which the Company participates; and Continue to develop Lexmarks brand awareness and brand positioning. In addition to investments in the Lexmark brand, the successful execution of this strategy involves increased investment in product and solution development. The Company increased its research and development spending by 10% in 2006, by 8% in 2005 and by 18% in 2004. This investment has led to new products and solutions aimed at targeted growth segments as well as a pipeline of future products. The Companys strategy for dot matrix printers and other office imaging products is to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit. Refer to the section entitled Strategy in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of the Companys strategies and initiatives. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Lexmarks discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, doubtful accounts, inventories, stock based compensation, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, copyright fees, restructurings, pension and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. Lexmark bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Lexmark records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. Lexmark also records estimated reductions to revenue for price protection, which it provides to substantially all of its distributor and reseller customers. The amount of price protection is limited based on the amount of dealers and resellers inventory on hand (including in transit inventory) as of the date of the price change. If market conditions were to decline, Lexmark may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings or reduce prices, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. 28 Table of Contents Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Lexmark maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due, the financial health of its customers, unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience. If the financial condition of its customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments, the Company records additional allowances as needed. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, Lexmark implemented the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) and related interpretations. SFAS 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. The Company selected the modified prospective transition method for implementing SFAS 123R and began recognizing compensation expense for stock based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, plus any unvested awards granted prior to January 1, 2006. Under this transition method, prior periods have not been restated. Stock based compensation expense for awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, is based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Stock based compensation related to any unvested awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, is based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The fair value of the Companys stock based awards, less estimated forfeitures, is amortized over the awards vesting periods on a straight line basis. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for the costs of its stock based employee compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations. Under APB 25, compensation cost was not recognized for substantially all options granted because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SEC Staffs interpretation of SFAS 123R and provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. The Company has incorporated the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R. The fair value of each option award on the grant date was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted average risk free interest rate and weighted average expected life of the options. Under SFAS 123R, the Companys expected volatility assumption used in the Black Scholes option pricing model was based exclusively on historical volatility and the expected life assumption was established based upon an analysis of historical option exercise behavior. The risk free interest rate used in the Black Scholes model was based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the Companys expected term assumption. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on the Class A Common Stock and has no current plans to pay cash dividends on the Class A Common Stock. The payment of any future cash dividends will be determined by the Companys board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including the Companys earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions, tax laws, certain corporate law requirements and various other factors. Restructuring Lexmark records a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for liabilities for certain employee termination benefit charges that are accrued over time. Specifically for termination benefits under a one time benefit arrangement, the 29 Table of Contents timing of recognition and related measurement of a liability depends on whether employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and, if so, whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period. For employees who are not required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits or employees who will not provide service beyond the minimum retention period, the Company records a liability for the termination benefits at the communication date. If employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and will be retained to render service beyond the minimum retention period, the Company measures the liability for termination benefits at the communication date and recognizes the expense and liability ratably over the future service period. For contract termination costs, Lexmark records a liability for costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term when the Company terminates the agreement in accordance with the contract terms or when the Company ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. The Company records a liability for other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity in the period in which the liability is incurred. Once Company management approves an exit or disposal activity, the Company closely monitors the expenses that are reported in association with the activity. Warranty Lexmark provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The amounts accrued for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty, estimated product failure rates, and material usage and service delivery costs. The estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results. For extended warranty programs, the Company defers revenue in short term and long term liability accounts (based on the extended warranty contractual period) for amounts invoiced to customers for these programs and recognizes the revenue ratably over the contractual period. Costs associated with extended warranty programs are expensed as incurred. To minimize warranty costs, the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required. Inventory Reserves and Adverse Purchase Commitments Lexmark writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. The Company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements, product life cycle, product pricing and quality issues. Also, Lexmark records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required. Long Lived Assets Lexmark performs reviews for the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If future expected undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, then an impairment loss is recognized based upon the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the anticipated cash flows on a discounted basis. Such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset, expected periods that an asset may be utilized and appropriate discount rates. Lexmark also reviews any legal and contractual obligations associated with the retirement of its long lived assets and records assets and liabilities, as necessary, related to the cost of such obligations. Costs associated with such obligations that are reasonably estimable and probable are accrued and expensed, 30 Table of Contents or capitalized as appropriate. The asset recorded is recorded during the period in which it occurs and is amortized over the useful life of the related long lived tangible asset. The liability recorded is relieved when the costs are incurred to retire the related long lived tangible asset. The cost of each obligation is estimated based on current law and technology; accordingly, such estimates could change materially as the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates based on expenditures against established reserves and the availability of additional information. The Companys asset retirement obligations are currently not material. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans The Companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The non U.S. pension plans use economic assumptions similar to the U.S. pension plan. Significant assumptions the Company must review and set annually related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are: Expected long term return on plan assets based on long term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources. Discount rate reflects the rates at which benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments. Effective December 31, 2005, the Company began using a yield curve approach to determine the assumed discount rate in the U.S. based on the timing of the cash flows of the expected future benefit payments. Rate of compensation increase based on the Companys long term plans for such increases. Effective April 2006, this assumption is no longer applicable to the U.S. pension plan due to the benefit accrual freeze in connection with the Companys 2006 restructuring actions. Differences between actual and expected asset returns on equity investments are recognized in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost over five years. The deferred amounts resulting from this averaging process did not have a significant impact on current period operating results and are not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations for 2007. Actual results that differ from assumptions that fall outside the 10% corridor, as defined by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future service period of the plan participants. For 2006, a 25 basis point change in the assumptions for asset return and discount rate would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost. Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position and recognition in other comprehensive earnings of certain gains and losses that arise during the period, but are deferred under pension accounting rules. Income Taxes The Company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. These estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets. If the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate, if the Company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably, the Company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established. Likewise, if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed, if the Company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably, the Company could potentially experience significant gains. 31 Table of Contents In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold as more likely than not that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, financial statement disclosure and transition rules. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is recognition: The enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any litigation. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of FIN 48 related to all of the Companys tax positions for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company has not completed its evaluation of FIN 48 but estimates the cumulative effect to be an increase to retained earnings in the range of $0 to $20 million. Copyright Fees Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have taken action to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content. Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices. The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country. The Company has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the risks related to the copyright fee issues currently pending. The financial impact on the Company, which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes, the Companys and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and the Companys ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon competitive market conditions, remains uncertain. Contingencies and Litigation In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, Lexmark records a provision for a loss contingency when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary To improve profitability and the Companys cost and expense structure, Lexmark announced a number of actions in January 2006 that were implemented during the year: The Company implemented a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales which resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% of its worldwide inkjet business. Although this action negatively impacted revenue in 2006, this improvement in the quality of Lexmarks install base will have a positive effect over time. The Company announced a plan to restructure its workforce, consolidate some supplies manufacturing capacity, to reduce costs and expenses in the areas of supply chain, general and administrative expense, as well as marketing and sales support functions and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans. During 2006, the Company incurred restructuring related 32 Table of Contents charges and project costs of $135.1 million and realized approximately $60 million of total savings and expects to save approximately $80 million annually beginning in 2007. See Restructuring Related Charges, Project Costs and Other that follows for further discussion. Except for approximately 100 positions expected to be eliminated during 2007, the restructuring related activities were substantially complete at the end of 2006. In 2006, Lexmark continued to make progress on its core strategic initiatives in both product segment expansion and brand development resulting in new product introductions with new families of low end monochrome lasers, color lasers, laser MFPs and inkjet AIOs. These new products received significant industry recognition and awards. In 2006, the Company also experienced branded unit growth in its key focus segments with strong growth in low end monochrome lasers, color lasers, laser MFPs and inkjet AIOs. Additionally, in late 2006, Lexmark launched the next step in its brand development initiative with the start of a new television advertising campaign along with radio, print and outdoor advertising in targeted geographic and market segments. This integrated campaign highlights Lexmarks deep and proven experience serving 75% of the top banks, retailers and pharmacies while highlighting the opportunity for small and medium businesses and consumers to benefit from our business class expertise. The Company will continue this campaign in 2007 as Lexmarks focus in 2007 will be to drive branded unit growth in its key growth segments. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The following table summarizes the results of the Companys operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in Millions) Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Revenue $ 5,108 .1 100 .0% $ 5,221 .5 100 .0% $ 5,313 .8 100 .0% Gross profit 1,646 .0 32 .2 1,635 .6 31 .3 1,791 .4 33 .7 Operating expense 1,203 .5 23 .6 1,101 .9 21 .1 1,059 .3 19 .9 Operating income 442 .5 8 .7 533 .7 10 .2 732 .1 13 .8 Net earnings 338 .4 6 .6 356 .3 6 .8 568 .7 10 .7 During 2006, total revenue was $5.1 billion or down 2% from 2005. Laser and inkjet supplies revenue increased 3% year to year (YTY) as good growth in laser supplies was partially offset by declines in inkjet supplies. Laser and inkjet hardware revenue decreased 8% with growth in laser hardware units more than offset by the decrease in inkjet hardware units. During 2006, in the Business segment, revenue increased 3% YTY. Laser unit shipments increased approximately 9% YTY. Laser hardware average unit revenue (AUR), which reflects the changes in both pricing and mix, decreased approximately 9% YTY reflecting price declines and a mix shift to low end monochrome lasers. During 2006, in the Consumer segment, revenue decreased 8% YTY. Inkjet unit shipments decreased approximately 20% YTY. Inkjet hardware AUR increased approximately 2% YTY as a favorable product mix shift to AIOs was partially offset by price declines. Additionally, the Company sees the potential for continued erosion in end user inkjet supplies demand due to the reduction in inkjet hardware unit sales reflecting both the Companys decision to focus on more profitable printer placements and weakness in its OEM business which it is currently experiencing. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased 5% from the prior year due to lower operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Net earnings in 2006 include $135.1 million of pre tax restructuring related charges and project costs, a $9.9 million pre tax pension curtailment gain, $43.2 million of pre tax stock based compensation expense and a $14.3 million income tax benefit from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the finalization of certain tax audits and the expiration of 33 Table of Contents various domestic and foreign statutes of limitation. Net earnings in 2005 included increased income tax expense of $51.9 million resulting from the board approval to repatriate $684 million of foreign dividends during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net earnings in 2005 also included one time pre tax termination benefit charges of $10.4 million related to the workforce reduction announced in the third quarter of 2005. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005, decreased 37% compared to 2004. The decrease in net earnings was principally due to lower operating income as a result of lower gross profits and increased income tax expense as discussed above. Net earnings in 2005 also included the one time termination benefit charges as discussed above. Net earnings in 2004 included a $20 million tax benefit due to the settlement of all outstanding issues with the Internal Revenue Service on audits for the years 1997 2001. Revenue The following tables provide a breakdown of the Companys revenue by product category and market segment as well as hardware unit shipments: Revenue by product: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 % Change 2005 2004 % Change Laser and inkjet printers $ 1,663.0 $ 1,799.4 (8 )% $ 1,799.4 $ 2,000.1 (10 )% Laser and inkjet supplies 3,211.6 3,117.2 3 3,117.2 2,974.8 5 Other 233.5 304.9 (23 ) 304.9 338.9 (10 ) Total revenue $ 5,108.1 $ 5,221.5 (2 )% $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% Unit shipments: (Units in Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Laser units 2.1 2.0 1.7 Inkjet units 14.7 18.4 18.3 Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in both 2006 and 2005 when compared to the prior period. During 2006, laser and inkjet supplies revenue increased 3% YTY as good growth in laser supplies was partially offset by declines in inkjet supplies. Laser and inkjet hardware revenue decreased 8% with growth in laser hardware units more than offset by the decrease in inkjet hardware units. During 2005, laser and inkjet supplies revenue increased 5% YTY with increases in both laser and inkjet supplies. Laser and inkjet printer revenue decreased 10% YTY with decreases in both laser and inkjet printer revenue. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, one customer, Dell, accounted for $744 million or approximately 15%, $782 million or approximately 15%, and $570 million or approximately 11% of the Companys total revenue, respectively. Sales to Dell are included in both the Business and Consumer segments. Revenue by market segment: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 % Change 2005 2004 % Change Business $ 2,869.1 $ 2,774.8 3 % $ 2,774.8 $ 2,816.6 (1 )% Consumer 2,239.0 2,446.7 (8 ) 2,446.7 2,497.2 (2 ) Total revenue $ 5,108.1 $ 5,221.5 (2 )% $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% Business segment During 2006, revenue in the Business segment increased $94 million or 3% compared to 2005 principally due to higher laser supplies revenue. During 2006, laser hardware unit shipments increased approximately 34 Table of Contents 9% YTY with strong growth in branded unit sales partially offset by declines in OEM unit sales. Laser hardware AUR decreased approximately 9% YTY reflecting price declines and a mix shift to low end monochrome lasers. During 2005, revenue in the Business segment decreased $42 million or 1% compared to 2004. This decrease was principally due to decreased hardware revenue attributable to more aggressive pricing and lower than expected supplies revenue growth. During 2005, the Company experienced a 15% unit growth in laser unit shipments, but saw significant hardware price declines and a continuing mix shift to low end products. Laser hardware AUR was down approximately 20% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting the impact of pricing and a continuing unfavorable mix shift to low end monochrome lasers. Consumer segment During 2006, revenue in the Consumer segment decreased $208 million or 8% compared to 2005 primarily due to decline in inkjet hardware units. During 2006, inkjet unit shipments decreased approximately 20% YTY. Inkjet hardware AUR increased approximately 2% YTY as a favorable product mix shift to AIOs was partially offset by price declines. During 2005, revenue in the Consumer segment decreased $51 million or 2% compared to 2004. This decrease was principally due to decreased hardware revenue attributable to more aggressive pricing and promotion activities and lower than expected supplies revenue growth. During 2005, the Company experienced about flat YTY unit sales and saw significant hardware price declines. Inkjet hardware AUR was down approximately 15% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting the impact of pricing partially offset by a more favorable mix shift to AIOs. Revenue by geography: The following table provides a breakdown of the Companys revenue by geography: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 % Change 2005 2004 % Change United States $ 2,245.3 $ 2,360.5 (5 )% $ 2,360.5 $ 2,397.8 (2 )% Europe 1,843.1 1,853.8 (1 ) 1,853.8 1,926.3 (4 ) Other International 1,019.7 1,007.2 1 1,007.2 989.7 2 Total revenue $ 5,108.1 $ 5,221.5 (2 )% $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% During 2006, revenue decreased in the U.S. primarily due to the previously mentioned decline in inkjet hardware units. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue in Europe and Other International geographies during 2006. During 2005, revenue decreased in the U.S. and Europe geographies due to the previously mentioned aggressive pricing and promotion activities and softer than expected supplies growth, partially offset by the increase in revenue in the Other International geographies when compared to 2004. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue in Europe and Other International geographies during 2005. Gross Profit The following table provides gross profit information: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 Change 2005 2004 Change Gross profit dollars $ 1,646.0 $ 1,635.6 1% $ 1,635.6 $ 1,791.4 (9)% % of revenue 32.2% 31.3% 0.9pts 31.3% 33.7% (2.4)pts During 2006, consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased when compared to the prior year. The change in the gross profit margin over the prior period was primarily due to a 3.3 percentage point favorable mix shift among products, mostly from a decrease in the percentage of inkjet hardware and an increase in laser supplies, partially offset by a decrease in hardware margins in 35 Table of Contents both inkjet and lasers. Gross profit in 2006 also included $42.1 million (or a 0.8 percentage point impact) of restructuring related charges, primarily relating to accelerated depreciation, and project costs. See Restructuring Related Charges, Project Costs and Other that follows for further discussion. Gross profit in 2006 also included $6.0 million of stock based compensation expense. During 2005, consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased when compared to the prior year. The change in the gross profit margin from 2004 was principally due to lower product margins of 5.2 percentage points which was mostly printer driven, partially offset by a 2.8 percentage point favorable mix shift among products toward supplies. During 2005, the Company continued efforts begun in 2002 to execute supplier managed inventory (SMI) agreements with its primary suppliers to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. In instances where a non cancelable commitment is made to purchase product at a cost greater than the expected sales price, the Companys accounting policy is to recognize a liability and related expense for future losses. During 2005, several products transitioned to SMI agreements that were not previously under such agreements. The pre tax benefit in 2005 to the Company of this transition was approximately $49 million which was reflected as lower adverse purchase commitment charges. The benefit of products transitioning to SMI agreements in 2004 was approximately $18 million. As of December 31, 2005, the significant majority of major printer suppliers were under new SMI agreements. There was no measurable benefit of products transitioning to SMI agreements in 2006. Any impact on future operations would depend upon factors such as the Companys ability to negotiate new SMI agreements and future market pricing and product costs. Operating Expense The following table presents information regarding the Companys operating expenses during the periods indicated: 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in Millions) Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Research and development $ 370.5 7.3 % $ 336.4 6.4 % $ 312.7 5.9 % Selling, general & administrative 761.8 14.9 755.1 14.5 746.6 14.0 Restructuring and other, net 71.2 1.4 10.4 0.2 Total operating expense $ 1,203.5 23.6 % $ 1,101.9 21.1 % $ 1,059.3 19.9 % Research and development increased in 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior year due to the Companys continued acceleration of investment to support product and solution development. This investment has led to new products and solutions aimed at targeted growth segments. Additionally, research and development in 2006 includes $6.9 million of stock based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2006 includes $30.3 million of stock based compensation expense and $11.9 million of project costs related to the 2006 restructuring. See Restructuring Related Charges, Project Costs and Other that follows for further discussion. Restructuring and other, net, in 2006 includes $81.1 million of restructuring related charges for the 2006 restructuring plan partially offset by a $9.9 million pension curtailment gain from the pension plan freeze. In 2005, the Company incurred $10.4 million of one time termination benefit charges related to the 2005 workforce reduction. See Restructuring Related Charges, Project Costs and Other that follows for further discussion. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) The following table provides operating income by market segment: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 Change 2005 2004 Change Business $ 600.1 $ 661.0 (9 )% $ 661.0 $ 752.2 (12 )% % of segment revenue 20.9% 23.8% (2.9 )pts 23.8% 26.7% (2.9 )pts Consumer 246.0 232.1 6% 232.1 333.2 (30 )% % of segment revenue 11.0% 9.5% 1.5pts 9.5% 13.3% (3.8 )pts All other (403.6 ) (359.4 ) (12 )% (359.4 ) (353.3 ) (2 )% Total operating income (loss) $ 442.5 $ 533.7 (17 )% $ 533.7 $ 732.1 (27 )% % of total revenue 8.7% 10.2% (1.5 )pts 10.2% 13.8% (3.6 )pts During 2006, the decrease in consolidated operating income was primarily attributable to a $102 million increase in operating expenses as discussed above partially offset by a $10 million increase in gross profit. Operating income for the Business segment decreased $61 million due to lower gross profits, the impact of restructuring related charges and project costs and the increased investment in research and development. Operating income for the Consumer segment increased $14 million due to increased gross profits partially offset by the impact of restructuring related charges and project costs. During 2006, the Company incurred restructuring related charges and project costs of $35.9 million in its Business segment, $57.2 million in its Consumer segment and $42.0 million in All other. All other operating income also includes a $9.9 million pension curtailment gain from the pension plan freeze. During 2005, the decrease in consolidated operating income was primarily due to a $156 million decrease in gross profit attributable to gross profit margin erosion and a $43 million increase in operating expenses compared to 2004. Operating income for the Business and Consumer segments decreased $91 million and $101 million, respectively, compared to 2004 primarily due to lower gross profits attributable to lower revenues and lower product margins in each segment. During 2005, the Company incurred one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million related to its 2005 Workforce Reduction plan. For the $10.4 million of one time termination benefit charges, the Company recorded $6.5 million in its Business segment, $2.6 million in its Consumer segment and $1.3 million in All other. Interest and Other The following table provides interest and other information: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Interest (income) expense, net $ (22.1 ) $ (26.5 ) $ (14.5 ) Other expense (income), net 5.3 6.5 0.1 Total interest and other (income) expense, net $ (16.8 ) $ (20.0 ) $ (14.4 ) Total interest and other (income) expense, net, was income of $17 million in 2006 compared to income of $20 million in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income in 2006 compared to the prior year as a result of a decreased level of cash and marketable securities held by the Company during the year partially offset by higher interest rates in 2006 compared to 2005. Total interest and other (income) expense, net, was income of $20 million in 2005 compared to income of $14 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to $12 million of additional interest income attributable to higher interest rates in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $4 million in 2005 compared to foreign exchange gains of $2 million in 2004. 37 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes and Related Matters The Companys effective income tax rate was approximately 26.3%, 35.6% and 23.8% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 effective income tax rate included $14.3 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the finalization of certain tax audits and the expiration of various domestic and foreign statutes of limitation. The 2005 effective income tax rate was impacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) signed by the President of the U.S. on October 22, 2004. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. On April 28, 2005, the Companys board of directors approved a Domestic Reinvestment Plan (DRP) under the AJCA. Pursuant to the DRP, the Company repatriated $684 million for which it will claim the 85 percent dividends received deduction provided by the AJCA. The Companys 2005 income tax provision included $51.9 million to cover the Federal, State, and foreign income taxes the Company has estimated it would owe in connection with its repatriation of the $684 million. During 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the Companys income tax returns for all years through 2001. As a result of the completion of those audits, the Company reversed previously accrued taxes, reducing the income tax provision by $20 million in the third quarter of 2004. The IRS has started its examination of tax years 2004 and 2005. The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to tax examinations in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations. During 2006, the Company was subject to a tax holiday in Switzerland with respect to the earnings of one of the Companys wholly owned Swiss subsidiaries. The holiday expired at the end of 2006. The benefit derived from the tax holiday was $1.6 million in 2006, $11.5 million in 2005 and $4.9 million in 2004. The Company has non U.S. tax loss carryforwards of $123.4 million, of which $107.3 million are subject to a valuation allowance. For the remaining $16.1 million of loss carryforwards, $14.9 million have an indefinite carryforward period and $1.2 million will expire from 2009 to 2013. The Company believes that, for all tax loss carryforwards where a valuation allowance has not been provided, the assets will be realized because there will be sufficient income in the future to absorb the losses. On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP 123R 3). The Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in FSP 123R 3 for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company has not completed its evaluation of FIN 48 but estimates the cumulative effect to be an increase to retained earnings in the range of $0 to $20 million. 38 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased 5% from the prior year due to lower operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Net earnings in 2006 include $135.1 million of pre tax restructuring related charges and project costs, a $9.9 million pre tax pension curtailment gain, $43.2 million of pre tax stock based compensation expense and a $14.3 million income tax benefit from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the finalization of certain tax audits and the expiration of various domestic and foreign statutes of limitation. Net earnings in 2005 included increased income tax expense of $51.9 million resulting from the board approval to repatriate $684 million of foreign dividends during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net earnings in 2005 also included one time pre tax termination benefit charges of $10.4 million related to the workforce reduction announced in the third quarter of 2005. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005, decreased 37% compared to 2004. The decrease in net earnings was principally due to lower operating income as a result of lower gross profits and increased income tax expense as discussed above. Net earnings in 2005 also included the one time termination benefit charges as discussed above. Net earnings in 2004 included a $20 million income tax benefit due to the settlement of all outstanding issues with the Internal Revenue Service on audits for the years 1997 2001. Earnings per Share The following table summarizes basic and diluted net earnings per share: 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings per share: Basic $ 3.29 $ 2.94 $ 4.38 Diluted 3.27 2.91 4.28 For the year ended December 31, 2006, both basic and diluted net earnings per share include the restructuring related charges and project costs, pension curtailment gain, stock based compensation expense and income tax benefit as discussed above. The increases over the prior year in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily attributable to the decrease in the average number of shares outstanding, primarily due to the Companys stock repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2005, both basic and diluted net earnings per share included increased income tax expense as discussed above. The decreases in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily attributable to decreased net earnings partially offset by the decrease in the average number of shares outstanding due to the Companys stock repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2004, both basic and diluted net earnings per share included a benefit associated with the previously mentioned tax settlement. RESTRUCTURING RELATED CHARGES, PROJECT COSTS AND OTHER 2006 Restructuring During the first quarter of 2006, the Company approved a plan to restructure its workforce, consolidate some manufacturing capacity and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans (collectively referred to as the 2006 actions). The workforce restructuring eliminated or transferred over 1,400 positions from various business functions and job classes, with over 850 positions being eliminated, and over 550 positions being transferred from various locations primarily to low cost countries. As previously reported in 2006, an additional 100 positions are expected to be eliminated during 2007. Lexmark consolidated its manufacturing capacity to reduce manufacturing costs, including the closure of its Rosyth, Scotland inkjet cartridge manufacturing facility and Orleans, France laser toner facilities, and reduced its operating expenses, particularly in the areas of supply chain, general and administrative and marketing and sales support. 39 Table of Contents Lexmark also froze pension benefits in its defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees, effective April 3, 2006, and at the same time changed from a maximum Company matching contribution of three percent of eligible compensation to an automatic Company contribution of one percent and a maximum Company matching contribution of five percent to Lexmarks existing 401(k) plan. Additionally, for 2006, the Company is making a six percent contribution to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan on compensation amounts in excess of IRS qualified plan limits. Except for the additional 100 positions mentioned above, the restructuring related activities were substantially complete at the end of 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred net charges of $111.2 million for the 2006 actions as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Accelerated depreciation charges $ 40.0 Employee termination benefit charges 75.9 Contract termination charges 5.2 Subtotal restructuring related charges 121.1 Defined benefit pension plan freeze (9.9 ) Total restructuring related charges and other, net $ 111.2 The accelerated depreciation charges were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, and resulted from the Companys decision to close certain manufacturing facilities in Europe. The accelerated depreciation charges are included in Cost of revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Employee termination benefit charges were accrued in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146), and SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, as appropriate. Employee termination benefit charges include severance, medical and other benefits. Contract termination and lease charges were also accrued in accordance with SFAS 146. Employee termination benefit charges, contract termination and lease charges and the defined benefit pension plan freeze are included in Restructuring and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following table presents a rollforward of the liability incurred for employee termination benefit and contract termination and lease charges in connection with the restructuring related activities. The liability is included in Accrued liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. (Dollars in Millions) Balance at January 1, 2006 $ Costs incurred 81.1 Payments (46.6 ) Other(1) (4.4 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 30.1 (1) Other consists primarily of special termination benefits that are paid out of the U.S. pension plan. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred total restructuring related charges of $121.1 million. The Company incurred restructuring related charges of $35.2 million in its Business segment, $54.7 million in its Consumer segment and $31.2 million in All other. All other operating income also included a $9.9 million pension plan freeze benefit. The Company also incurred additional charges related to the execution of the Companys restructuring related activities (referred to as project costs). The project costs are incremental to the Companys normal operating charges and are expensed as incurred. Project costs include such items as travel and employee relocation associated with the Companys restructuring related activities. 40 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred net charges, including project costs, of $125.2 million for the 2006 actions as follows: Restructuring Related Charges & (Dollars in Millions) Other (Note 4) Project Costs Total Accelerated depreciation charges / project costs $ 40.0 $ 2.1 $ 42.1 Employee termination benefit charges / project costs 75.9 11.9 87.8 Contract termination and lease charges 5.2 5.2 Subtotal restructuring related charges / project costs 121.1 14.0 135.1 Defined benefit pension plan freeze (9.9 ) (9.9 ) Total restructuring related charges, project costs and other, net $ 111.2 $ 14.0 $ 125.2 For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred restructuring related charges and project costs of $35.9 million in its Business segment, $57.2 million in its Consumer segment and $42.0 million in All other. All other operating income also included a $9.9 million pension plan freeze benefit. During 2006, the Company realized approximately $60 million of total savings related to the 2006 actions including the pension curtailment gain, with approximately 55% benefiting cost of revenue and 45% benefiting operating expense. The restructuring related activities, substantially completed at year end 2006, are expected to save approximately $80 million beginning in 2007 with approximately 65% benefiting cost of revenue and 35% benefiting operating expense. The remaining accrued liability balance as noted above is expected to be substantially paid out by the end of 2007. These payments will relate primarily to employee termination benefits. Additionally, the Company expects to sell the Rosyth, Scotland facility to a third party in the first quarter of 2007. 2005 Workforce Reduction In order to optimize the Companys expense structure, the Company approved a plan during the third quarter of 2005 that would reduce its workforce by approximately 275 employees worldwide from various business functions and job classes. The separation of the affected employees was completed by December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company incurred one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million related to the plan that is included in Restructuring and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For the $10.4 million of one time termination benefit charges, the Company recorded $6.5 million in its Business segment, $2.6 million in its Consumer segment and $1.3 million in All other. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS The following table provides the total pre tax cost related to Lexmarks retirement plans for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004. Cost amounts are included as an addition to the Companys cost and expense amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total cost of pension and other postretirement plans $ 34.4 $ 43.8 $ 27.5 Comprised of: Defined benefit pension plans $ 12.5 $ 26.1 $ 9.5 Defined contribution plans 20.5 13.6 12.8 Other postretirement plans 1.4 4.1 5.2 The increase in the cost of defined benefit pension plans in 2005 was primarily due to the recognition of previous years investment losses and a curtailment loss due to restructuring in the U.S. The decrease in 41 Table of Contents the cost of defined benefit pension plans in 2006 was primarily due to the $9.9 million one time curtailment gain from the freezing of benefit accruals in the U.S. which is not expected to recur. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The increase in the cost of defined contribution plans in 2006 was primarily due to the enhancement of benefits in the U.S. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The decrease in the cost of other postretirement plans in 2006 was primarily due to plan design changes. Changes in actuarial assumptions did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations in 2006, nor are they expected to have a material effect in 2007. Future effects of retirement related benefits on the operating results of the Company depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates and investment performance. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the Companys pension and other postretirement plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was enacted on August 17, 2006. Most of its provisions will become effective in 2008. The Act significantly changes the funding requirements for single employer defined benefit pension plans. The funding requirements will now largely be based on a plans calculated funded status, with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses. The Act directs the U.S. Treasury Department to develop a new yield curve to discount pension obligations for determining the funded status of a plan when calculating the funding requirements. The provisions of the Act are not expected to have material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financial Position Lexmarks financial position remains strong at December 31, 2006, with working capital of $506 million compared to $936 million at December 31, 2005. The decrease in working capital accounts was primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in 2006 resulting primarily from the Companys stock repurchase activity. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $149.8 of long term debt and no short term debt outstanding. The debt to total capital ratio was 13% at December 31, 2006, compared to 9% at December 31, 2005. The Company had no amounts outstanding under its U.S. trade receivables financing program or its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006. Liquidity The following table summarizes the results of the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years indicated: (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flows provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 670.9 $ 576.4 $ 775.4 Investing activities 112.7 4.9 (688.1 ) Financing activities (808.7 ) (1,036.9 ) (209.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1.4 (2.3 ) 3.7 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (23.7 ) $ (457.9 ) $ (118.4 ) The Companys primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations, which totaled $671 million, $576 million and $775 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the Company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately $0.9 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.3 billion of its Class A Common Stock during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management believes that cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating and capital needs. However, in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient, the Company 42 Table of Contents has other potential sources of cash through utilization of its accounts receivable financing program, revolving credit facility or other financing sources. Operating activities The increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2005 to 2006 resulted from favorable changes in Accrued liabilities and Accounts payable partially offset by unfavorable changes in Inventories and various other assets and liabilities accounts. The change noted in Accrued liabilities was primarily due to increases in salary and incentive compensation accruals and related payments of $67 million, favorable changes in derivative liabilities of $42 million and increases in restructuring related accruals of $28 million compared to the prior year. Accounts payable balances can fluctuate significantly between periods due to the timing of payments to suppliers. The Companys days of inventory increased from 44 days at December 31, 2005, to 46 days at December 31, 2006, primarily due to increased supplies inventory. The change noted in the Other assets and liabilities line item in 2006 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was primarily attributable to changes in various income tax related accounts from 2005. Although not a significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities, the Companys days of sales outstanding were 35 days at December 31, 2006, compared to 39 days at December 31, 2005. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to decreased earnings. The cash flow changes in working capital accounts were principally due to the Companys continued focus on cash cycle management and timing of payments. Trade receivables decreased from 2004 as December 2005 sales were lower than the prior year. The Companys days of sales outstanding were 39 days at December 31, 2005, up slightly from 38 days at December 31, 2004. The Companys days of inventory decreased from 47 days at December 31, 2004, to 44 days at December 31, 2005, due to the Companys continued focus on inventory management. Accounts payable decreased from 2004 primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers. The changes noted in the Accrued liabilities and Other assets and liabilities line items in 2005 were primarily attributable to decreases in the Companys derivative liabilities, decreases in compensation accruals and changes in various income tax related accounts from 2004. The days of sales outstanding is calculated on a three month moving average based on gross accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns, and is adjusted for certain accounts receivable items which have no corresponding revenue, such as value added taxes. The days of inventory is calculated on a three month moving average based on annualized cost of goods sold excluding any restructuring related charges and project costs. The days of sales outstanding and days of inventory calculations are non GAAP measures and based on internal definitions and may not be comparable to other companies calculations. Cash flows from operations were reduced during 2006, 2005 and 2004 by $4 million, $3 million and $53 million, respectively, due to contributions to the Companys defined benefit pension plans. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company pension and other postretirement plans. In connection with the 2006 restructuring, the remaining accrued liability balance at December 31, 2006, of $30.1 million, is expected to be substantially paid out by the end of 2007. These payments will relate primarily to employee termination benefits. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had accrued approximately $98 million for pending copyright fee issues, including litigation proceedings, local legislative initiatives and or negotiations with the parties involved. These accruals are included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 43 Table of Contents Investing activities The Company began investing in marketable securities during the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in a net use of cash of $490 million in 2004. The Company decreased its marketable securities investments in 2005 by $220 million and by $315 million in 2006 due to its share repurchase program activity. Refer to the section, Stock Repurchase, which follows for further discussion of the Companys stock repurchase program during 2006. The Company spent $200 million, $201 million and $198 million on capital expenditures during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The capital expenditures in 2006 were related to new product development, infrastructure support and manufacturing capacity expansion. Financing activities The fluctuations in the net cash flows from financing activities were principally due to the Companys share repurchase activity. The Company repurchased $0.9 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.3 billion of treasury stock during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Credit Facility Effective January 20, 2005, Lexmark entered into a $300 million 5 year senior, unsecured, multi currency revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Upon entering into the credit agreement, the Company terminated the prior $300 million unsecured, revolving credit facility that was due to expire on May 29, 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination. Under the credit facility, the Company may borrow in dollars, euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $500 million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. Lexmarks credit agreement contains usual and customary default provisions, leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The $300 million credit facility has a maturity date of January 20, 2010. Interest on all borrowings under the facility depends upon the type of loan, namely alternative base rate loans, swingline loans or eurocurrency loans. Alternative base rate loans bear interest at the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent. Swingline loans (limited to $50 million) bear interest at an agreed upon rate at the time of the borrowing. Eurocurrency loans bear interest at the sum of (i) a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the applicable currency and interest period and (ii) an interest rate spread based upon the Companys debt ratings ranging from 0.18% to 0.80%. In addition, Lexmark is required to pay a facility fee on the $300 million line of credit of 0.07% to 0.20% based upon the Companys debt ratings. The interest and facility fees are payable at least quarterly. Long term Debt Lexmark has outstanding $150.0 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due May 15, 2008, which was initially priced at 98.998%, to yield 6.89% to maturity. A balance of $149.8 million (net of unamortized discount of $0.2 million) was outstanding at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, the balance was $149.6 million (net of unamortized discount of $0.4 million). The senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the Company, at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement, as supplemented and amended, in whole or in part. During October 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert its $150.0 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. Interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150.0 million were executed whereby the Company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately 2.76% above the six month 44 Table of Contents LIBOR. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of May 15, 2008, which is equivalent to the maturity date of the senior notes. Other Information The Company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt. However, a downgrade in the Companys credit rating could adversely affect the Companys ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (Dollars in Millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 150 $ $ 150 $ $ Capital leases 6 3 3 Operating leases 130 37 50 26 17 Purchase obligations 207 207 Other long term liabilities 24 6 2 16 Total contractual obligations $ 517 $ 247 $ 209 $ 28 $ 33 Purchase obligations reported in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The Companys funding policy for its pension plans is to fund minimum amounts according to the regulatory requirements under which the plans operate. From time to time, the Company may choose to fund amounts in excess of the minimum for various reasons. The annual funding of pension obligations are not expected to be material and are not shown above. Trade Receivables Facility In October 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated agreement to sell a portion of its trade receivables on a limited recourse basis. The amended agreement allows for a maximum capital availability of $200 million under this facility. The primary purpose of the amendment was to extend the term of the facility to October 16, 2007, with required annual renewal of commitments in October 2005 and 2006. In October 2006, the facility was renewed until October 5, 2007. This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold. As collections reduce previously sold receivables, the Company may replenish these with new receivables. Lexmark bears a limited risk of bad debt losses on the trade receivables sold, since the Company over collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables. Lexmark addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables sold to the unrelated third party may not include amounts over 90 days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. The facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which, if triggered, could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables. A downgrade in the Companys credit rating could reduce the Companys ability to sell trade receivables. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no trade receivables outstanding under the facility. 45 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. The Company maintains a facility whereby it may sell trade receivables to an unrelated third party as discussed above. Stock Repurchase In January 2006, the Company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional $1.0 billion of its Class A Common Stock for a total repurchase authority of $3.9 billion. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $0.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. This repurchase authority allows the Company, at managements discretion, to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors. During 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $0.9 billion. As of December 31, 2006, since the inception of the program in April 1996, the Company had repurchased approximately 71.4 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had reissued approximately 0.5 million shares of previously repurchased shares in connection with certain of its employee benefit programs. As a result of these issuances as well as the retirement of 44.0 million and 16.0 million shares of treasury stock in 2005 and 2006, respectively, the net treasury shares outstanding at December 31, 2006, were 10.9 million. On December 20, 2005 and October 26, 2006, the Company received authorization from the board of directors to retire 44.0 million and 16.0 million shares, respectively, of the Companys Class A Common Stock currently held in the Companys treasury as treasury stock. The retired shares resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Earnings for the effects on Common stock, Capital in excess of par, Retained earnings and Treasury stock from the retirement of the 44.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in 2005 and 16.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in 2006. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures totaled $200 million, $201 million and $198 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The capital expenditures in 2006 were attributable to new product development, infrastructure support and manufacturing capacity expansion. During 2007, the Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $235 million, primarily attributable to new product development, infrastructure support and manufacturing capacity expansion. The capital expenditures are expected to be funded through cash from operations. EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EXCHANGE RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Revenue derived from international sales, including exports from the U.S., accounts for approximately 56% of the Companys consolidated revenue, with Europe accounting for approximately two thirds of international sales. Substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies. Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Certain of the Companys Latin American and European entities use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Currency exchange rates have had less of an impact on international revenue in recent years. In 2006 and 2005, currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on operating income, while the 2004 operating income was materially positively affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The Company acts to neutralize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges, such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions. The Companys exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges. Therefore, the Company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual 46 Table of Contents and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities, which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The Company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 (ARB 43), Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that . . .under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. . .. SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of SFAS 151, effective January 1, 2006, did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In September 2005, the FASB reached a final consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13). EITF 04 13 concludes that two or more legally separate exchange transactions with the same counterparty should be combined and considered as a single arrangement for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, when the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another. The consensus contains several indicators to be considered in assessing whether two transactions are entered into in contemplation of one another. If, based on consideration of the indicators and the substance of the arrangement, two transactions are combined and considered a single arrangement, an exchange of finished goods inventory for either raw material or work in process should be accounted for at fair value. The provisions of EITF 04 13 should be applied to transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006. The adoption of EITF 04 13, effective April 1, 2006, did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In October 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 was issued to address the accounting for rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. FSP 13 1 concludes that these rental costs shall be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. The guidance in FSP 13 1 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 13 1, effective January 1, 2006, did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (collectively referred to as FSP 115 1). FSP 115 1 provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115 1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. FSP 115 1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 115 1, effective January 1, 2006, did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 47 Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) (EITF 06 3). EITF 06 3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. EITF 06 3 concludes that the presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. The provisions of EITF 06 3 should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. The provisions of EITF 06 3 will not impact the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows upon adoption. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company has not completed its evaluation of FIN 48 but estimates the cumulative effect to be an increase to retained earnings in the range of $0 to $20 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption permitted. The provisions of SFAS 157 should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, with limited exceptions. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108) expressing the Staffs views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. There have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement errors: the rollover method and the iron curtain method. The rollover method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements, but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. The iron curtain method, on the other hand, focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the entitys financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it essentially requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the rollover methods. The provisions of SAB 108 are applicable to annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) 48 Table of Contents (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to: a. Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. b. Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, or SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, including the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition asset or obligation remaining from the initial application of SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106, are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to the recognition and amortization provisions of those Statements. c. Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position (with limited exceptions). d. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. Retrospective application is not permitted. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impact of adoption on the Companys financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides entities with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Business entities adopting SFAS 159 will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date on items for which the fair value option has been elected. SFAS 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 requires additional information that will help investors and other financial statement users to understand the effect of an entitys choice to use fair value on its earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 159. INFLATION The Company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures. As a result, future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases, the Company must continually manage its product costs and manufacturing processes. 49 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY The market risk inherent in the Companys financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rates At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Companys senior notes was estimated at $152 million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements, taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt. The fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31, 2006, by approximately $2 million. Market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $1 million at December 31, 2006. The Company has interest rate swaps that serve as a fair value hedge of the Companys senior notes. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006, was a liability of $2 million. Market risk for the interest rate swaps is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $1 million at December 31, 2006. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The Company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the Companys functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed include the euro, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Australian dollar and other Asian and South American currencies. Exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, put options, and call options generally with maturity dates of twelve months or less. The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2006, for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $29 million. This loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures. 50 Table of Contents
