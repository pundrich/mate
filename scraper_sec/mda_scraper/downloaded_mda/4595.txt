ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations Clearly, 2006 will be remembered as an incredibly challenging year for Ameren, as well as for the communities served by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. For the better part of the second half of 2006, Ameren was focused on addressing the consequences resulting from unprecedented summer and winter storms. In 2006, UE also continued its extensive restoration efforts associated with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk pumped storage, hydroelectric facility and settled related liability matters with federal authorities. Unfortunately, UE did not receive a unified settlement offer from all relevant Missouri state authorities. On February 2, 2007, UE submitted plans and an environmental report to the FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir of the Taum Sauk plant assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with authorities of the state of Missouri. Because of the likelihood of higher electric rates in Illinois following the end of a legislative rate freeze on January 2, 2007, certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the Illinois governor, and other parties sought to block an ICC approved auction that occurred in September 2006 to procure power for use by the Ameren Illinois Utilities customers beginning in 2007. These parties continue to challenge the auction process and the recovery of costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates to customers. To mitigate the impact of the electric rate increases on customers, an electric rate increase phase in plan was approved by the ICC in December 2006. In November, the Ameren Illinois Utilities also received an ICC order increasing their electric delivery service rates by an aggregate of $97 million. This order authorized a 10% return on equity, but was significantly less than the Ameren Illinois Utilities request for approximately a $200 million increase primarily because of the disallowance of significant levels of expenses, which the Ameren Illinois Utilities believe were prudently incurred. Primarily as a result of this order and cost increases since the 2004 base year for setting these rates, the return on equity in 2007 for the Ameren Illinois Utilities will be meaningfully below the 10% return on equity allowed by the order. A rehearing was granted on a portion of the disallowed costs. The necessity and timing of additional electric delivery services rate increase requests in Illinois will be influenced by the result of this rehearing, which is expected in May 2007. In July 2006, UE filed for its first electric rate increase in almost 20 years. UEs electric rate filing included a proposed annual increase in electric rates of $361 million. UE also filed last July for an increase in natural gas delivery rates of $11 million annually. Interveners in the electric rate case have recommended rate reductions. Decisions are expected by the MoPSC by June 2007. While 2006 was full of challenges, we did remain focused on our core operations and were able to achieve several notable accomplishments. From an operational standpoint, Amerens power plants performed very well in 2006, setting records for generation output. Availability and capacity factors of the Missouri Regulated coal fired power plants were comparable with solid 2005 results, averaging 90% and 82%, respectively. In 2006, Amerens non rate regulated coal fired plants improved their availability from 82% to 85% year over year and capacity factors from 68% to 73%. We also successfully executed our plan to hedge most of our estimated available 2007 non rate regulated 31 Table of Contents generation due to the expiration of our below market contracts at the end of 2006. Earnings Ameren reported earnings of $2.66 per share for 2006 which compared to earnings of $3.02 per share last year. Amerens earnings in 2005 included an 11 cent per share charge for the adoption of a new accounting principle related to AROs. Earnings in 2006 were affected by restoration efforts associated with severe storms that reduced Amerens net income by 26 cents per share. In addition, costs related to the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility decreased 2006 earnings by 20 cents per share. Ameren also incurred a charge of 5 cents per share related to funding commitments for low income energy assistance and energy efficiency programs associated with the December 2006 ICC order associated with the electric rate increase phase in plan. Incremental gains of approximately 9 cents per share in 2006, associated with the sale of certain non core properties, including leveraged leases, reduced the negative impact of these items. Earnings in 2006 were also unfavorably affected by escalating costs for fuel and related transportation, operating materials, and financing costs and depreciation associated with significant energy infrastructure investments in Amerens regulated electric and gas utility businesses. In addition, earnings were significantly affected by mild summer and winter weather, as well as lower power prices for excess energy sales as compared to 2005. Market prices for power in 2005 were higher than 2006 as a result of the significant impact of hurricanes and rail disruptions in 2005. Operating results in 2006 benefited from organic sales growth; improved plant performance; the lack of a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant; Illinois electric commercial and industrial customers returning to tariff rates because these rates were below market rates for power; and higher sales levels of emission allowances. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.3 billion in 2006 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $522 million and fund capital expenditures of $992 million and CT acquisitions of $292 million. Financing activities in 2006 primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment with borrowings under credit facilities. Outlook Electric rates in Illinois are expected to continue to be a source of debate among legislators and regulators in 2007. Proposed actions have included freezing rates at 2006 levels despite significantly higher purchased power costs for the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Any decision or action that impairs the ability of CIPS, CILCO and IP to fully recover costs from their electric customers in a timely manner would result in material adverse consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP. CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to take whatever actions are necessary to protect their financial interests, including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts. The ultimate resolution of pending electric and gas rate cases in Missouri, coupled with a final decision in the rehearing of certain electric delivery service rate case issues in Illinois, will have a significant impact on earnings in 2007 and 2008. Amerens regulated utilities are expected to experience significant increases in the costs of serving their customers, including coal and related transportation costs that are expected to increase by 15% to 20% in 2007 and another 5% to 10% in 2008. Many of these costs will be in excess of those reflected in 2007 regulated rates because rates are largely based on historical costs. Ameren expects to realize significantly higher electric margins due to the replacement of below market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with higher priced contracts in 2007. In the future, Ameren also expects to realize lower income associated with the sale of emission allowances and noncore properties than realized in 2006. While Ameren expects continued economic growth in its service territory to benefit energy demand in 2007 and beyond, higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers. The EPA, together with state authorities, is requiring more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2007 and 2016, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. Approximately half of this investment will be at UE and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust to reflect this increased investment by the industry. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005 administered by FERC. Ameren was registered with the SEC as a public utility holding company under PUHCA 1935 until that act was repealed effective February 8, 2006. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries, which are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets and liabilities, operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois, as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution 32 Table of Contents business in Missouri. Before May 2, 2005, UE also operated those businesses in Illinois. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a non rate regulated electric generation business. CILCO, a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company), operates a rate regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a non rate regulated electric generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG) and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Amerens Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods before September 30, 2004, do not reflect IPs results of operations or financial position. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the accounting for the IP acquisition. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. About 90% of Amerens revenues were directly subject to state or federal regulation in 2006. This regulation can have a material impact on the prices we charge for our services. Our non rate regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We do not currently have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri for our electric utility businesses. We do have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri and Illinois for our gas delivery businesses. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of pending rate cases and the Illinois power procurement auction process and related tariffs. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems, the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Amerens net income was $547 million ($2.66 per share) for 2006, $606 million ($3.02 per share) for 2005, and $530 million ($2.84 per share) for 2004. In 2005, Amerens net income included a net cumulative effect aftertax loss of $22 million (11 cents per share) associated with recording liabilities for conditional AROs as a result of our adoption of FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The net cumulative effect aftertax loss of adopting FIN 47 is presented below for the applicable registrant companies: Net Cumulative Effect Aftertax Loss Ameren(a) $ 22 Genco 16 CILCORP 2 CILCO 2 IP (a) Includes amounts for EEI. Amerens income before cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 47 decreased $81 million and earnings per share decreased 47 cents in 2006 compared with 2005. Earnings were negatively impacted in 2006 by: costs and lost electric margins associated with outages caused by severe storms (26 cents per share); milder weather conditions (estimated at 17 cents per share); costs associated with the upper reservoir breach in December 2005 at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric plant (20 cents per share); an unscheduled outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant (7 cents per share); higher depreciation expense (11 cents per share); increased taxes other than income taxes (8 cents per share); contributions made in association with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan (5 cents per share); increased fuel and purchased power costs; and higher financing costs. An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005. 33 Table of Contents Earnings were favorably impacted in 2006 by: Higher margins on interchange sales (33 cents per share); increased net gains on the sale of noncore properties, including leveraged leases, compared with 2005 (9 cents per share); the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in 2006 (18 cents per share); increased sales of emission allowances (5 cents per share); and other factors including improved plant operations, lack of coal conservation efforts, industrial electric customers switching back to the Ameren Illinois Utilities, lower bad debt expenses and organic growth. Cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2005. Amerens net income before cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 47 in 2005 increased $98 million and earnings per share increased 29 cents in 2005 compared with 2004. Earnings were favorably impacted in 2005 by: warmer weather in the summer of 2005 compared with extremely mild conditions in the summer of 2004 (estimated at 26 cents per share); inclusion of IP results for an additional nine months in 2005 (23 cents per share); increased margins on interchange sales (11 cents per share); the lower cost of the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in 2005 versus the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage (3 cents per share); increased emission allowance sales earnings (2 cents per share); net gains on sales of noncore properties, including leveraged leases in 2005 (7 cents per share); lower employee benefit costs (5 cents per share); and other factors including organic growth. Earnings were negatively impacted in 2005 by: incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market (29 cents per share); the lack of a FERC ordered refund of $18 million in exit fees as had occurred in 2004 this fee had previously been paid by UE and CIPS to the MISO, upon their re entry into the MISO (6 cents per share); increased labor costs (8 cents per share); and other factors including increased fuel and purchased power costs and coal conservation efforts in 2005. An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2005 compared with 2004. Cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2004. Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 Net income: UE(a)(b) $ 343 $ 346 $ 373 CIPS 35 41 29 Genco(a) 49 97 107 CILCORP(a) 19 3 10 IP(c) 55 95 27 Other(d) 46 24 (16 ) Ameren net income $ 547 $ 606 $ 530 (a) Includes earnings from market based interchange power sales that provided the following contributions to net income: UE: 2006 $65 million; 2005 $75 million; 2004 $75 million. Genco: 2006 $20 million; 2005 $47 million; 2004 $39 million. CILCORP: 2006 $18 million; 2005 $13 million. (b) Includes earnings from a non rate regulated 40% interest in EEI. (c) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition on September 30, 2004. (d) Includes earnings from non rate regulated operations and a 40% interest in EEI held by Development Company, corporate general and administrative expenses, gains on sales of noncore assets (2005 and 2006), transition costs associated with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions (2004), and intercompany eliminations. Before the third quarter of 2006, Ameren reported one segment, Utility Operations, comprising electric generation and electric and gas transmission and distribution operations. Ameren holding company activity was listed in the caption called Other. As a result of the following changes in circumstances, Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO changed their segments in the third quarter of 2006: the Ameren Companies chief operating decision making group began to assess the performance and allocate resources based on a new segment structure and made related organizational and management reporting changes in the third and fourth quarters of 2006; electric generation deregulation in Illinois, which became effective on January 1, 2007; the expiration of affiliate power supply agreements for CIPS and CILCO, and other supply agreements for IP on December 31, 2006; the July 2006 termination of the JDA among UE, Genco and CIPS effective December 31, 2006; and the September 2006 completion of a statewide auction to procure power for CIPS, CILCO and IP for 2007 and beyond, and Marketing Companys sale in that auction of power being acquired from Genco and AERG. In the third quarter of 2006, Ameren determined that it has three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated, Illinois Regulated and Non rate regulated Generation. UE determined that it has one reportable segment: Missouri Regulated. CILCORP and CILCO determined that they have two reportable segments: Illinois Regulated and Non rate regulated Generation. A discussion of changes in components of net income between periods by business segment is provided below where material. Prior period 34 Table of Contents presentation has been adjusted for comparative purposes. See Note 17 Segment Information to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of Amerens, UEs, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments.

Therefore, 2004 included IP results for just three months. See discussion below in each respective section for the effect of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005. 35 Table of Contents Margins The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in the registrants electric and gas margins from the previous year. Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. We consider electric, interchange and gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. The variations in electric and gas margins for Ameren show the contribution from IP for the first nine months of 2005 as a separate line item, which allows an easier comparison with other margin components. The variation in IP electric margin in 2005 is compared with the full year of 2004, despite Amerens acquisition of IP occurring on September 30, 2004. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ (82 ) $ (39 ) $ (16 ) $ $ (10 ) $ (10 ) $ (17 ) Storm related outages (estimate) (10 ) (9 ) (3 ) 3 (1 ) Noranda 46 46 Illinois service territory transfer (38 ) 41 34 Wholesale contracts (76 ) (76 ) Interchange revenues(b) 236 (26 ) (34 ) (46 ) 8 8 Transmission service and other revenues (32 ) (4 ) 3 2 2 2 (12 ) Growth and other (estimate) 72 27 27 40 12 12 67 Total electric revenue change $ 154 $ (43 ) $ 18 $ (43 ) $ 12 $ 12 $ 37 Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ (15 ) $ 3 $ $ (10 ) $ 6 $ 8 $ 1 Sales of emission allowances 14 30 (21 ) Price (82 ) (40 ) (18 ) (20 ) (20 ) Purchased power (31 ) 69 (15 ) (10 ) 29 29 (52 ) Storm related energy costs (estimate) 1 2 (1 ) (1 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ (113 ) $ 64 $ (15 ) $ (60 ) $ 15 $ 17 $ (52 ) Net change in electric margins $ 41 $ 21 $ 3 $ (103 ) $ 27 $ 29 $ (15 ) Net change in gas margins $ (24 ) $ (13 ) $ 1 $ $ (10 ) $ (10 ) $ 1 2005 versus 2004 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP(c) Electric revenue change: IP January through September 2005 $ 861 $ $ $ $ $ $ Effect of weather (estimate) 115 72 24 16 16 51 Noranda 81 81 Illinois service territory transfer (104 ) 101 74 Rate reductions (7 ) (7 ) Interchange revenues 79 143 (1 ) 67 (20 ) (20 ) Transmission service and other revenues 30 (15 ) 10 (6 ) (1 ) (1 ) (5 ) Growth and other (estimate) 9 59 38 29 1 1 5 Total electric revenue change $ 1,168 $ 229 $ 172 $ 164 $ (4 ) $ (4 ) $ 51 Fuel and purchased power change: IP January through September 2005 $ (509 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ Fuel: Generation and other (97 ) (57 ) (13 ) (17 ) (15 ) Sales of emission allowances 5 (26 ) 21 Price (45 ) (41 ) (29 ) 25 25 Purchased power (156 ) (127 ) (131 ) (160 ) (20 ) (20 ) (62 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ (802 ) $ (251 ) $ (131 ) $ (181 ) $ (12 ) $ (10 ) $ (62 ) Net change in electric margins $ 366 $ (22 ) $ 41 $ (17 ) $ (16 ) $ (14 ) $ (11 ) Net change in gas margins $ 120 $ 10 $ $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004, and includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

(c) Includes predecessor information for periods before September 30, 2004. 36 Table of Contents 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens electric margin increased by $41 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in Amerens electric margin were as follows: A $162 million, or 67%, increase in margins on interchange sales. The expiration of EEIs affiliate cost based power supply contract on December 31, 2005, the expiration of several large Marketing Company power supply contracts in 2006, and an increase in plant availability provided Ameren with additional power to sell in the spot market. The increase in margins on interchange sales from these items was reduced by lower power prices, resulting from declining market prices for natural gas, the significant impact of hurricanes and rail disruptions on prices in 2005. Plant efficiencies, primarily at CILCO (AERG), as Amerens baseload electric generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 80% and 88%, respectively, in 2006 compared with 76% and 86%, respectively, in 2005. The lack of a UE Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in an increased electric margin of $25 million. Upgrades performed during the refueling and maintenance outage in 2005, which increased Callaways output and electric margin by $22 million. Organic growth and industrial customers who switched back to below market Illinois tariff rates because of the expiration of power contracts with suppliers. Lower purchased power costs at IP. Sales to Noranda, which began receiving power on June 1, 2005, resulting in increased electric margin of $20 million at UE. Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling $14 million, and lower emission allowance costs, totaling $5 million, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to a decrease in Amerens electric margin were as follows: Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decline in cooling degree days, that reduced the electric margin by $33 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Severe storm related outages in 2006 that reduced overall electric margin by $9 million as less electricity was sold for native load, partially offset by an increase in margins on the sales of this power on the interchange market. An increase in fuel and purchased power costs for native load at UE and Genco due to the expiration of a cost based power supply contract with EEI. A 12% increase in coal and transportation prices. A $25 million reduction in margins because of the unavailability of UEs Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant in 2006 compared with 2005. An $11 million reduction in native load margins from UEs other hydroelectric generation in 2006 compared with 2005. An unscheduled outage in 2006 at UEs Callaway nuclear plant, which reduced electric margins by an estimated $20 million. Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to the elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Amerens gas margin decreased by $24 million, or 6%, in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily because of the following factors: Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in heating degree days, which reduced the gas margin by $15 million in 2006 from 2005. Weather sensitive residential and commercial gas sales volumes decreased by 8% each, in 2006 compared with 2005. Unrecoverable purchased gas costs, together with unfavorable customer sales mix totaling $19 million. Factors contributing to an increase in Amerens gas margin were as follows: An IP rate increase that became effective in May 2005, which added revenues of $6 million in 2006. Increased sales to customers, excluding the impact from weather, of 2%, or $4 million. Missouri Regulated UE UEs total electric margin increased by $21 million in 2006 from 2005. UEs Missouri Regulated electric margin increased by $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in UEs electric margin were as follows: Sales to Noranda that increased electric margin by $20 million and other organic growth. Increased sales of emission allowances, totaling $30 million. The lack of a scheduled Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2006. Capacity upgrades at the Callaway plant during the refueling and maintenance outage in 2005. UEs other electric margin increased by $12 million as a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin 108. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Accounting Changes and Other Matters, to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for further information. Factors that contributed to a decrease in UEs electric margin were as follows: Unfavorable weather conditions that reduced electric margin by $11 million, as evidenced by an 8% decline in cooling degree days in 2006 compared with 2005. Severe storm related outages in 2006 that reduced electric native load sales and resulted in an estimated net reduction in overall electric margin of $6 million. Lower margins on nonaffiliate interchange sales in 2006 compared with 2005, which resulted from reduced 37 Table of Contents power prices. The average realized power prices on UEs interchange sales decreased from $48 per megawatthour in 2005 to $37 per megawatthour in 2006. However, margins on interchange sales benefited from the January 10, 2006, amendment of the JDA. The MoPSC required and FERC approved change in the JDA methodology (to basing the allocation of third party short term power sales of excess generation on generation output instead of load requirements) resulted in $23 million in incremental margins on interchange sales for UE in 2006 compared with 2005. The transfer of UEs Illinois service territory in May 2005 to CIPS, which decreased electric margin by an estimated $22 million in 2006 compared with 2005. A 9% increase in coal and related transportation prices. Fees of $4 million levied by FERC in 2006 for prior years generation benefits provided to UEs Osage hydroelectric plant. Reduced electric margin because of the unavailability of UEs Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant. Reduced electric margin from UEs other hydroelectric generation, due to drought like conditions across the central and southern portions of Missouri. An unscheduled 20 day outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in the second quarter of 2006 that reduced electric margin (maintenance expenses were covered under warranty). MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, which were $6 million higher in 2006, as this market did not begin operating until the second quarter of 2005. The expiration of a cost based power supply contract with EEI on December 31, 2005. Reduced transmission service revenues of $13 million, primarily due to elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market. UEs gas margin decreased by $13 million, or 18%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to the decreased margins were as follows: Mild winter weather conditions that reduced gas margins by $2 million, as evidenced by an 8% decrease in heating degree days in 2006 compared with 2005. The transfer of UEs Illinois service territory in May 2005 to CIPS, which reduced gas margin by $4 million. A reduction in gas sales to customers, excluding the impacts from weather. Unrecoverable purchased gas costs totaling $4 million.

See below for explanations of electric and gas margin variances for the Illinois Regulated segment. CIPS CIPS electric margin increased by $3 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in CIPS electric margin were as follows: The transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory in May 2005, which increased electric margin by $7 million. Primarily industrial customers, switching back to CIPS from Marketing Company in 2006 because tariff rates were below market rates for power. Decrease in MISO Day Two Energy Market costs of $7 million. Increased miscellaneous revenues of $2 million. Factors contributing to a decrease in CIPS electric margin were as follows: Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 9% decrease in cooling degree days in 2006 compared with 2005 that reduced electric margins by $7 million. Severe storm related outages in 2006 that reduced electric sales and reduced the electric margin by $3 million. Reduced transmission service revenues, primarily due to elimination of interim cost recovery mechanisms, and reduced revenues associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Due to the expiration of CIPS cost based power supply agreement with EEI in December 2005, pursuant to which CIPS sold its entitlements under the agreement to Marketing Company, both interchange revenues and purchased power expenses decreased by $34 million in 2006 compared with 2005. CIPS gas margin increased by $1 million, or 1%, in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily because the transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory in May 2005 added $4 million to gas margin. CIPS increase in gas margin was reduced by mild winter weather, as evidenced by a 10% decrease in heating degree days in 2006 compared with 2005, which reduced the gas margin by $3 million. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The following table provides a reconciliation of CILCOs change in electric margin by segment to CILCOs total change in electric margin for 2006 compared with 2005: 2006 versus 2005 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) $ 7 CILCO (AERG)(a) 22 Total change in electric margin $ 29 (a) See Non rate regulated Generation under Results of Operations for a detailed explanation of CILCOs (AERG) change in electric margin in 2006 compared with 2005.

Non rate regulated Generation Non rate regulated Generations electric margin increased by $53 million, or 8%, in 2006 compared with 2005. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Non rate regulated Generation segment. Genco Gencos electric margin decreased by $103 million, or 22%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to a decrease in Gencos electric margin were as follows: Lower wholesale margins as Genco purchased additional power at higher costs to supply Marketing Company after the expiration of the cost based power supply contract between EEI and its affiliates on December 31, 2005. Higher net emission allowance costs because of a $21 million gain at Genco in the third quarter of 2005, which resulted from the nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage year SO2 emission allowances for later vintage year allowances. A 9% increase in coal and transportation prices. Lower margins on interchange sales in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of lower power prices, and a $23 million reduction in 2006 due to the amendment of the JDA among UE, Genco and CIPS. The average realized power prices on Gencos interchange sales decreased from $47 per megawatt in 2005 to $38 per megawatt hour in 2006. Higher MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling $12 million in 2006 compared with 2005, since the market did not begin operating until the second quarter of 2005. Gencos decrease in electric margin was reduced by increased sales to CIPS as a result of the May 2005 transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS. CILCO (AERG) AERGs electric margin increased by $22 million, or 25%, in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to an increase in AERGs electric margin were as follows: Lower purchased power costs due to improved power plant availability. A decrease in emission allowance utilization expenses of $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005. 39 Table of Contents An increase in margins on interchange sales due to improved plant availability. AERGs electric generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 69% and 81%, respectively, in 2006 compared with 61% and 73%, respectively, in 2005. AERGs electric margin was reduced by a 31% increase in coal and transportation prices in 2006 over 2005. EEI EEIs electric margin increased by $194 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors contributing to EEIs increase in electric margin were as follows: An increase in margins on interchange sales, which resulted from the expiration of its affiliate cost based sales contract on December 31, 2005, and its replacement with an affiliate market based sales contract. Sales of emission allowances. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Amerens electric margin increased by $366 million in 2005 compared with 2004. An additional nine months of IP results was included in 2005, which added $352 million of electric margin. Other factors contributing to an increase in Amerens electric margin were as follows: An increase in margin on interchange sales of $66 million in 2005 compared with 2004, principally because of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Average realized prices on Amerens interchange sales increased from $30 per megawatthour in 2004 to $44 per megawatthour in 2005. Higher market prices for natural gas, emission allowances, and coal in 2005 contributed to the higher power prices. Hurricanes and disruptions in coal delivery contributed to these higher prices. The MISO Day Two Energy Market also contributed to an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $34 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. With the inception of the MISO Day Two Energy Market in 2005, all transmission losses, previously borne by the energy providers, were transferred to MISO, which effectively allowed the generation units to increase sales by approximately 1.8%. Favorable weather conditions, as warmer summer weather in 2005 compared with extremely mild conditions in the summer of 2004 resulted in a 37% increase in cooling degree days in 2005 in Amerens service territory. Excluding the additional nine months of IP sales in 2005, Amerens weather sensitive residential and commercial sales were up 10% and 3%, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004. Sales to Noranda, which increased electric margin by $33 million. Effective June 1, 2005, UE began to supply approximately 470 megawatts (peak load) of electric service (or about 5% of UEs generating capability, including committed purchases) to Norandas primary aluminum smelter in southeast Missouri under a 15 year agreement. Organic growth. Factors contributing to a decrease in Amerens electric margin were as follows: MISO costs that were $107 million higher in 2005 compared with 2004. MISO costs increased as a result of line losses, transmission congestion charges, and charges associated with volatile weather conditions and deviations of actual from forecasted plant availability and customer loads. Some of these higher costs were attributed to the relative infancy of the MISO Day Two Energy Market, suboptimal dispatching of plants, and price volatility. Electric rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri that negatively affected electric revenues by $7 million during 2005. These were the final rate reductions under the 2002 rate case settlement. An extended refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in 2005. Expiration and nonrenewal of low margin, non rate regulated power sales contracts to customers outside our core service territory. Coal conservation efforts that reduced interchange sales. Unscheduled coal fired plant outages during the peak summer period, which resulted in increased higher cost CT generation used to serve the demand. Increased utilization and mark to market losses on emission allowance put options of $50 million in 2005. However, fuel and purchased power costs were reduced in 2005 by a $21 million gain at Genco resulting from the nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage year SO2 emission allowances for later vintage year emission allowances. Amerens gas margin increased by $120 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of the inclusion of an additional nine months of IP results in 2005. Excluding these IP results, gas margin increased $16 million, primarily due to UEs rate increase, which became effective in the first quarter of 2005, and more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of 2005 than in the same period in 2004. Missouri Regulated UE UEs electric margin decreased by $22 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to a decrease in UEs electric margin were as follows: The transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, which was completed in May 2005. This transfer resulted in an estimated decrease in electric margin of $74 million in 2005. Reduced electric rates in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004. 40 Table of Contents Increased MISO Day Two Energy Market costs totaling $59 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Coal conservation efforts that reduced excess plant production and interchange sales. Increased CT generation using high cost natural gas to serve increased summer demand. A $12 million decrease in emission allowance transactions in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to an increase in UEs electric margin were as follows: Sales to Noranda, which increased electric margin by $33 million. An increase in margins on interchange sales. Margins on interchange sales with nonaffiliates increased $26 million in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $23 million in 2005 compared to 2004, as a result of reduced transmission losses. Favorable weather conditions as evidenced by a 25% increase in cooling degree days in 2005 compared with 2004. UEs gas margin increased by $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004, because of the effect of a rate increase in the first quarter of 2005 and favorable weather. This increase was reduced by the May 2005 transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, which decreased the gas margin by $4 million. Illinois Regulated Illinois Regulateds electric margin increased by $41 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared with 2004. Illinois Regulateds gas margin increased by $5 million, or 2%, in 2005 compared with 2004. See below for explanations of the variances in electric and gas margins for the Illinois Regulated segment. CIPS CIPS electric margin increased by $41 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to an increase in CIPS electric margin were as follows: Increased native load sales as a result of the transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory. The transfer of the Illinois service territory resulted in an estimated increase in electric margin of $27 million in 2005. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 44% increase in cooling degree days in 2005 compared with 2004. Customers who switched back to CIPS from Marketing Company because tariff rates were below market rates. CIPS electric margin was reduced by a $23 million increase in MISO costs, included in purchased power, in 2005 compared with 2004. CIPS 2005 gas margin was comparable with 2004. The transfer to CIPS of UEs service territory and favorable weather conditions offset gas inventory and other adjustments. The service territory transfer increased CIPS gas margin by $4 million in 2005. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The following table provides a reconciliation of CILCOs change in electric margin by segment to CILCOs total change in electric margin for 2005 compared with 2004: 2005 versus 2004 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) $ 11 CILCO (AERG)(a) (25 ) Total change in electric margin $ (14 ) (a) See Non rate regulated Generation under Results of Operations for an explanation of CILCOs (AERG) change in electric margin in 2005 compared with 2004. CILCOs (Illinois Regulated) electric margin increased by $11 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of increased native load growth, primarily in the industrial sector, along with more favorable summer weather in 2005 than in 2004. CILCOs (Illinois Regulated) gas margin increased by $2 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of favorable weather in the fourth quarter of 2005. IP IPs electric margin decreased by $11 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of higher purchased power and MISO costs in 2005. Although power costs decreased in 2005 under IPs new power supply agreement with DYPM and related purchase accounting adjustments, costs on other power contracts were higher than in 2004. MISO costs included in purchased power were $9 million higher in 2005. The decrease in electric margin was reduced by weather that was more favorable in 2005 than in 2004. IPs gas margin increased by $2 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared with 2004 because of a rate increase effective in May 2005 that added $4 million. This benefit was reduced by unfavorable winter weather during the first quarter of 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Non rate regulated Generations electric margin increased by $27 million, or 4%, in 2005 compared with 2004. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Non rate regulated Generation segment. 41 Table of Contents Genco Gencos electric margin decreased by $17 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to a decrease in Gencos electric margin were as follows: A decrease in wholesale margins because Genco had to purchase higher cost power to serve Marketing Companys greater load. The increase in load was due to increased volume from the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS and warmer than normal weather. Increased purchased power, principally from UE under the JDA, was caused by a major power plant maintenance outage that occurred primarily during the first quarter of 2005. A $26 million increase in emission allowance utilization in 2005 compared with 2004. Emission allowance utilization was reduced in 2005 by a net gain of $15 million associated with a $21 million nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage year SO2 emission allowances for later vintage year emission allowances, reduced by losses of $6 million on emission allowance options. The decrease in Gencos electric margin was reduced by a $23 million increase in margins on interchange sales in 2005 over 2004. The increase in margins on interchange sales was the result of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $10 million in 2005 over 2004 as a result of reduced transmission losses. CILCO (AERG) AERGs electric margin decreased by $25 million, or 22%, in 2005 compared with 2004. Factors contributing to an increase in AERGs electric margin were as follows: Lower margins on nonaffiliated interchange sales as output from AERGs plants was reduced due to outages. The equivalent availability factor for AERGs plants was 73% in 2005 compared with 84% in 2004. The net capacity factor was 61% in 2005 compared with 66% in 2004. Higher fuel and purchased power costs because of unscheduled plant outages during the peak summer period and increased cost of emission allowance utilization totaling $20 million. An $8 million increase in MISO costs in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in electric margin was reduced by the use of low cost coal at one of AERGs power plants in 2005. EEI EEIs electric margin increased by $15 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of sales of emission allowances. Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $69 million in 2006 over 2005. We experienced the most damaging storms in the Ameren utilities history in our service territory during the summer of 2006, resulting in the loss of power to about 950,000 electric customers and expenses of $28 million. Severe ice storms in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in the loss of power to about 520,000 electric customers and expenses of $42 million. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses increased because of $25 million in costs related to the December 2005 reservoir breach at UEs Taum Sauk plant and $15 million of contributions to assist residential customers in association with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accepted by the ICC in December 2006. In addition, there were higher power plant maintenance expenses at our coal fired power plants due to the timing of maintenance outages, and an increase in legal fees for environmental issues and general litigation. The effect on other operations and maintenance expenses from transactions related to noncore properties, including the impairment of the Delta Air Lines, Inc., lease in 2005 as discussed below, was comparable between years. Reducing the unfavorable impact of the above items were lower labor costs and a decrease in bad debt expense of $17 million in 2006, primarily because an anticipated increase in uncollectible accounts due to high gas prices was mitigated by mild winter weather. In 2005, there was a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage that resulted in other operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million; there was no refueling and maintenance outage in 2006. The next refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway plant is scheduled for the spring of 2007. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 are outlined below. Missouri Regulated UE Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $15 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair expenditures of $38 million, incremental costs associated with the Taum Sauk incident of $25 million, as noted above, and higher power plant maintenance expenses at UEs coal fired power plants. Reducing the impact of these unfavorable items were decreased injuries and damages expenses, decreased bad debt expenses, lower labor and employee benefit costs, and the lack of a scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in other operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million in 2005. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $7 million 42 Table of Contents in 2006 as a result of the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $45 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois Regulated segment, as detailed below. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair expenditures of $6 million and the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005, which resulted in additional other operations and maintenance expenses of $7 million. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses increased because of contributions of $4 million associated with the electric rate increase phase in plan in 2006. The negative impact of these items was reduced by lower bad debt expense. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of lower employee benefit costs and reduced bad debt expenses. Reducing the benefit of these items were $3 million of contributions associated with the electric rate increase phase in plan, along with storm repair and tree trimming expenditures of $5 million in 2006. IP Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $46 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair expenditures of $24 million and contributions associated with the electric rate increase phase in plan of $8 million in 2006, along with higher rental expenses, and higher injuries and damages expenses. The negative effect of these items was reduced by lower labor and employee benefit costs. Non rate regulated Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $28 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, as detailed below. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of higher maintenance expenses resulting from increased scheduled power plant maintenance outages in 2006. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2006 and 2005, as decreased maintenance costs were offset by increased legal and environmental expenses. CILCORP (Parent Company Only) & EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $8 million at CILCORP (Parent Company Only) and $3 million at EEI in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of increased employee benefit costs. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $150 million in 2005 compared with 2004. IP expenses in the first nine months of 2005 added other operations and maintenance expenses of $166 million to Ameren (it was owned for only three months in 2004). Excluding these IP expenses, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million. Plant maintenance expenditures decreased as expenses related to the 2005 Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage were lower in 2005 than in 2004, as discussed below. Lower employee benefit costs also resulted in reduced other operations and maintenance expenses in 2005. Ameren and several subsidiaries consummated the sale of noncore properties, including leveraged lease assets, in 2005. The net pretax gain on the sale of these assets was $26 million, which reduced other operations and maintenance expenses. Reducing these favorable items was an impairment of $10 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for Amerens investment in a leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta Air Lines, Inc., which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2005. Additionally, labor costs, other than those incurred for the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. Ameren, UE and CIPS received a refund of previously paid exit fees totaling $18 million upon their reentry into the MISO during the second quarter of 2004. This refund did not recur in 2005 and, therefore, other operations and maintenance expenses for this item increased in 2005 relative to 2004. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Maintenance and labor costs for refueling and maintenance outages were $31 million in 2005 compared with $39 million in 2004. The 2005 and 2004 refueling and maintenance outages each lasted about 64 days; however, in 2005, the outage included more capital activities and less maintenance activities than in 2004. In 2005, Ameren replaced steam generators and turbine rotors in addition to normal maintenance procedures. Additionally, in 2004, there was an unscheduled outage at the Callaway nuclear plant and planned outages at two coal fired plants. The transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005 decreased other operations and maintenance expenses 43 Table of Contents by $16 million in 2005. Reducing these favorable variances were increased labor costs and storm damage expenses in 2005. Additionally, UE received a $13 million MISO exit fee refund during 2004. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $154 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005. Other variances between the years are discussed below. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses at CIPS were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Information technology, employee benefit, and administrative and general costs decreased in 2005. These positive items were offset by the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, which resulted in an increase in other operations and maintenance expenses of $16 million in 2005. Additionally, CIPS received a $5 million MISO exit fee refund during 2004 that did not recur in 2005. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) decreased $28 million in 2005 from 2004. These expenses decreased primarily because of lower employee benefit costs in 2005 and the absence of an $8 million charge we paid in 2004 to settle a litigation claim by Enron Power Marketing, Inc., in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of CILCORP in 2003. IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $39 million in 2005 over 2004, partly because IP received a refund of previously paid exit fees of $9 million from MISO during 2004. Other operations and maintenance expenses also increased, including tree trimming costs and overhead and labor costs associated with the integration of systems and operations with Ameren in 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, as detailed below. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco increased $4 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of a major power plant maintenance outage in 2005. These costs were reduced by lower employee benefit costs. CILCORP (Parent Company Only) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable in 2005 and 2004. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $6 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increased plant maintenance expenditures resulting from power plant outages. EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $5 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increased power plant maintenance expenditures. Depreciation and Amortization 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $29 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of capital additions. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in 2006 over 2005. The increases were primarily because of capital additions, a portion of which were related to new steam generators and turbine rotors installed during the refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2005, as well as CTs purchased in the first quarter of 2006. Additionally, depreciation increased due to CTs transferred to UE from Genco in May 2005. Reducing depreciation expense was the transfer of property to CIPS as part of the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in the Illinois Regulated segment, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP in 2006 and 2005. CIPS Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million at CIPS primarily because of property transferred from UE to CIPS as part of the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2006 and 2005 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for CILCORP (Parent Company only), Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 44 Table of Contents 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $75 million in 2005 from 2004, principally because of an additional nine months of IP results in 2005, which added $59 million. Capital additions also resulted in increased depreciation expenses in 2005. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses at UE increased $16 million in 2005 over 2004. The increases were primarily due to capital additions and depreciation on CTs transferred from Genco to UE in May 2005, partially offset by the elimination of depreciation on property transferred by UE to CIPS in the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $66 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005. Other variances between the years are discussed below. CIPS CIPS depreciation and amortization expenses increased $7 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of depreciation on property transferred in May 2005 from UE in the Illinois service territory transfer and capital additions. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) were comparable in 2005 and 2004. IP IPs depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding the amortization of regulatory assets, were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $33 million in 2005 from 2004. The transition cost regulatory asset was eliminated in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP in September 2004. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses in the Non rate regulated Generation segment decreased $4 million in 2005 compared with 2004, principally at Genco, because of the transfer of CTs from Genco to UE in May 2005. Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2005 and 2004 at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $26 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of higher gross receipts, and higher excise taxes and property taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006 and 2005. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes increased $18 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois Regulated segment. Taxes other than income taxes increased $8 million at CIPS, $4 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and $5 million at IP in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of higher property taxes and excise taxes. Non rate regulated Generation Taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million in 2006 compared with 2005 at Non rate regulated Generation, primarily because of higher property taxes at Genco. There was a favorable court decision in the first quarter of 2005 that did not recur in 2006. Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006 and 2005 at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $53 million in 2005 over 2004, principally because of an additional nine months of IP results in 2005, which added $54 million. Variations in taxes other than income taxes at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increased property taxes due to higher assessments. These property tax increases were mitigated in 2005 by the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS. 45 Table of Contents Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes increased $55 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005. Other variances between the years are discussed below. CIPS Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS were $7 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, primarily because of increased property taxes resulting from the transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory in May 2005. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Taxes other than income taxes decreased $4 million in 2005 from 2004 at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), primarily because of reduced gross receipts and property taxes. IP Taxes other than income taxes at IP were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Non rate regulated Generation Taxes other than income taxes decreased $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, primarily because of a favorable court decision in 2005 regarding property taxes at Genco. Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2005 and 2004 at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI. Other Income and Expenses 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Miscellaneous income increased $21 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of $24 million of interest income on a taxable industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE in conjunction with its purchase of a CT in the first quarter of 2006. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. This amount is offset by an equivalent amount of interest expense associated with a capital lease for the CT recorded in interest charges on Amerens and UEs statements of income. Miscellaneous expense decreased $8 million, primarily due to decreased donations in 2006 and the write off of unrecoverable natural gas costs in 2005. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Miscellaneous income increased $16 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of interest income on UEs CT capital lease as noted above, partially offset by lower capitalization of equity funds used during construction in 2006. In 2005, UE replaced steam generators and turbine rotors at the Callaway nuclear plant. Miscellaneous expense was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses were comparable at Illinois Regulated, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP in 2006 and 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Other income and expenses were comparable at Non rate regulated Generation, Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI in 2006 and 2005. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Other income and expenses at Ameren decreased $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Excluding the additional nine months of IP results in 2005, other income and expenses at Ameren decreased $14 million from 2004. Miscellaneous income decreased $8 million, primarily due to reduced interest income from the investment of equity issuance proceeds in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million, primarily because of unrecoverable natural gas cost write offs at CIPS and CILCO and integration costs at IP in 2005. Variations in other income and expenses at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other income and expenses were comparable in 2005 and 2004.

See Note 7 Other Income and Expenses to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Interest 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens interest expense increased $49 million in 2006 over 2005 primarily because of items noted below in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for each of the Ameren Companies individually. Missouri Regulated UE Interest expense increased $55 million in 2006 over 2005 as a result of the issuances of $300 million of senior secured notes in July 2005 and $260 million of senior secured notes in December 2005, along with increased short term borrowings, resulting in part from the purchase of CTs in the first quarter of 2006. Interest expense of $24 million was recognized on UEs capital lease associated with one of these CTs. This amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest income recorded in Other income and deductions on Amerens and UEs statements of income. Illinois Regulated Interest expense increased $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois Regulated segment, primarily because of the issuance of $75 million of senior secured notes in June 2006 along with increased money pool borrowings at IP. Interest expense at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Interest expense decreased $16 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment.

Interest expense at CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI was comparable in 2006 and 2005. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Interest expense increased $23 million at Ameren in 2005 over 2004, principally because of the acquisition of IP, which added $32 million of interest for the first nine months of 2005. Excluding the additional IP interest expense in 2005, Amerens interest expense decreased $9 million, primarily because of items discussed below in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for each of the Ameren Companies individually. Missouri Regulated UE UEs interest expense increased $13 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of the issuances of $300 million senior secured notes in July 2005, $85 million senior secured notes in January 2005, and $300 million senior secured notes in September 2004, partially offset by maturities of $188 million of first mortgage bonds in August 2004 and $85 million of first mortgage bonds in December 2004 and the redemption of $100 million first mortgage bonds in June 2004. Illinois Regulated Interest expense increased $24 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of the additional nine months of IP results in 2005.

CIPS Interest expense decreased $3 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of the redemption of $70 million of environmental revenue bonds in December 2004. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Interest expense was comparable in 2005 and 2004. IP Interest expense at IP decreased $87 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of redemptions and repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $70 million in early 2005 and reductions in notes payable to IP SPT. 47 Table of Contents Non rate regulated Generation Interest expense decreased $27 million in 2005 compared with 2004 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, as detailed below. Additionally, interest expense decreased $4 million at other non rate regulated subsidiaries, primarily because of reduced money pool borrowings. Genco Gencos interest expense decreased $21 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of the maturity of $225 million of senior notes in November 2005, lower average money pool borrowings, and a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren. The outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable to CIPS was $197 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $283 million at December 31, 2004. The intercompany note payable to Ameren was repaid in 2005. CILCORP (Parent Company Only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI Interest expense was comparable in 2005 and 2004. Income Taxes 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of differences between the book and tax treatment of the sale of noncore properties, as well as items discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows Missouri Regulated UE Effective tax rate increased over the prior year primarily because of an increase in nondeductible expenses and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions related to tax returns filed in the current year. Illinois Regulated Effective tax rate increased in 2006 from 2005 at Illinois Regulated, primarily because of the items detailed below. CIPS Effective tax rate decreased from the prior year, primarily because of favorable tax return to accrual adjustments.

EEI Effective tax rates were comparable in 2006 and 2005. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of items discussed below at the various subsidiaries. Variations in effective tax rates at Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2005 and 2004 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Effective tax rates were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Illinois Regulated Effective tax rate increased in the Illinois Regulated segment, primarily because of the items detailed below. 48 Table of Contents CIPS Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of unfavorable tax return to accrual adjustments.

IP Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of the cessation of amortization of investment tax credits after Amerens acquisition of IP. Non rate regulated Generation Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, primarily because of the items detailed below. Genco Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions based on unfavorable developments with taxing authorities, offset by deductions under Section 199. CILCORP (Parent Company Only) Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increases related to unfavorable tax return to accrual adjustments. CILCO (AERG) Effective tax rate increased in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions based on unfavorable developments with taxing authorities. EEI Effective tax rate decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of benefits related to the Section 199 deduction. 49 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. For operating cash flows prior to 2007, Genco principally relied on power sales to an affiliate under a contract that expired at the end of 2006, and on sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under short and long term contracts. Beginning in 2007, Genco and AERG will sell power previously sold under contracts that expired at the end of 2006 to Marketing Company, which has sold power through the Illinois power procurement auction and is selling power through other primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. The amount of power that Genco, AERG, EEI, Marketing Company and their affiliates may supply to CIPS, CILCO and IP through the Illinois power procurement auction is limited to 35% of CIPS, CILCOs and IPs aggregate annual load. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, each of the Ameren Companies plans to use available cash, money pool, or other short term borrowings from affiliates, commercial paper, or credit facilities to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The use of operating cash flows and short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit, as was the case at December 31, 2006, for Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP. The Ameren Companies will reduce their short term borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with long term borrowings or equity infusions from Ameren. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of an Illinois legislative proposal to freeze electric rates at 2006 levels for CIPS, CILCO and IP. If such legislation is enacted, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP will not have enough operating cash flow to support normal operations, which would lead to financial insolvency. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities (Used In) Investing Activities (Used In) Financing Activities 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Ameren(a) $ 1,279 $ 1,251 $ 1,112 $ (1,266 ) $ (961 ) $ (1,249 ) $ 28 $ (263 ) $ 95 UE 734 706 720 (732 ) (800 ) (551 ) (21 ) 66 (136 ) CIPS 118 133 73 (66 ) (12 ) 78 (46 ) (123 ) (165 ) Genco 138 213 183 (110 ) 95 (53 ) (27 ) (309 ) (131 ) CILCORP 133 33 137 (90 ) (109 ) (121 ) (42 ) 72 (20 ) CILCO 153 67 138 (161 ) (114 ) (126 ) 9 47 (18 ) IP(b) 172 148 247 (180 ) 9 (272 ) 8 (162 ) 13 (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) 2004 amounts include predecessor financial information prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2006 versus 2005 Amerens cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with 2005. As discussed in Results of Operations, electric margins increased by $41 million, while gas margins decreased by $24 million. Benefiting operating cash flows were an $84 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions in 2006 compared with 2005, and the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold December 2005 weather during the winter heating season. The cash impact from trade receivables was more significant in the current period because we had higher gas prices and colder December weather in 2005 than in the year ago period. Negative impacts on operating cash flow include a $216 million increase in income tax payments, expenditures of $59 million (including a $10 million FERC fine) associated with the breach of the Taum Sauk upper reservoir in December 2005, and $37 million of other operations and maintenance expenses due to severe storms. Most of the Taum Sauk expenditures are pending recovery from insurance carriers. In addition, there was an increase in cash used during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, including $9 million for other operations and maintenance and $14 million for annual incentive compensation. These expenses were higher than they were a year ago because of increased 2005 earnings relative to performance targets. The cash benefit from reduced natural gas inventories as a result of lower prices was offset by increased volume of coal inventory purchases because of the coal supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Pumped storage Hydroelectric Facility Breach to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information regarding the Taum Sauk incident. At UE, cash from operating activities increased in 2006. Overall margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005. Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable with the previous year, despite $59 million (including $10 million for a FERC fine) spent due to the breach of the Taum Sauk upper reservoir collapse as 50 Table of Contents discussed above for Ameren, and $24 million spent due to severe storms. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions were $61 million less than in the prior year. Income tax payments increased $51 million, and interest payments increased $40 million because there was increased debt outstanding. Cash used for coal purchases increased compared with 2005 because of alleviation of the coal supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. Cash used for working capital increased, largely because of storm related costs. At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased compared to the prior year. The negative cash effect of higher other operations and maintenance expenses was reduced by a small increase in electric and gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations. Income tax payments increased $55 million compared with the year ago period. Reducing this use of cash was a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions of $11 million in 2006 compared with 2005, and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in the year ago period. Gencos cash from operating activities in 2006 decreased compared with the 2005 period, primarily because of lower operating margins as discussed in Results of Operations, and increases in coal inventory. Income tax payments decreased in 2006 by $17 million compared with 2005, pension and postretirement benefit payments decreased $9 million, and interest payments were lower in the 2006 period because there was less debt outstanding. Cash from operating activities increased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily because of higher electric margins as discussed in Results of Operations, and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in the year ago period. In addition, income tax payments decreased $25 million for CILCORP and $17 million for CILCO. An increase in coal deliveries at CILCOs subsidiary, AERG, negatively affected cash. IPs cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Benefiting 2006 cash flows was the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold December 2005 weather during the heating season, as discussed above for Ameren, and a $1 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit payments. These increases were reduced by lower electric margins and higher other operations and maintenance expenses, including $9 million related to severe storms, net income tax refunds of $13 million in 2006 compared with $22 million in 2005, and cash used during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs as discussed above for Ameren, including an increase of $7 million in other operations and maintenance expenses, and an increase of $3 million in incentive compensation. 2005 versus 2004 Amerens increase in cash from operations in 2005, compared with 2004, was primarily attributable to $207 million of incremental IP operating cash flow in the nine months ended September 30, 2005, since Ameren did not own IP during the comparable period in 2004. Excluding the impact of IP, Amerens increase in electric and gas margins of $14 million and $16 million, respectively, also contributed to the increase in cash from operations. In addition, decreased pension and other postretirement benefit contributions of $206 million and decreased interest payments of $30 million contributed to the favorable variance in cash from operations. Reducing the positive variance in 2005 were increased tax payments of $159 million, the absence in 2005 of $36 million of cash from the UE coal contract settlement received in 2004, and an increase in net investment in inventories and trade receivables and payables due to higher gas prices and colder weather in December 2005 compared to December 2004. The absence in 2005 of $34 million of refunds in 2004 for previously paid fees to MISO and RTO start up costs also reduced the positive variance in cash from operations. Amerens working capital investment in coal inventories as of December 31, 2005, did not change significantly, compared with 2004, as a million ton decrease in volumes due to rail derailments was offset by higher prices. At UE, cash from operating activities in 2005 was generally consistent with changes in its results of operations and its operating cash flows in 2004. A $127 million decrease in pension and postretirement contributions benefited 2005 operating cash flow as compared with 2004. Significant items negatively impacting cash in 2005 compared with 2004 include: increased tax payments of $37 million; less cash from electric margins and emissions sales of $36 million; the impact of the coal contract settlement discussed above; the absence of $20 million received in 2004 for MISO exit fees and RTO start up costs discussed above; and increased working capital investment, primarily because of timing differences, prices, and weather as discussed above. CIPS increase in cash from operating activities in 2005 was principally due to increased electric margins of $41 million, a reduction of $23 million in pension and postretirement benefit contributions, and reduced interest and tax payments. This was reduced by increases in cash outflows caused by differences in the timing and amount of working capital items, compared with 2004. Cash from operating activities increased for Genco in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of reduced pension and postretirement contributions of $20 million and lower interest payments of $39 million. Reducing this increase were increased tax payments of $41 million. Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of increased tax payments of $60 million for CILCORP and $54 million for CILCO, lower electric margins of $16 million for CILCORP and $14 million for CILCO, and increased working capital investment at CILCORP and CILCO, primarily due to higher prices and colder weather, which increased inventories and receivables by $20 million and $28 million for CILCORP and $20 million and $31 million for CILCO. 51 Table of Contents CILCORPs cash from operating activities was also negatively affected by additional interest payments of $14 million in 2005 compared with 2004. These decreases were reduced by a decrease in pension and other postretirement contributions of $33 million. IPs cash from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was affected by Amerens ownership of IP for all of 2005 compared with only the fourth quarter of 2004. IPs operating cash flows in 2005 are not directly comparable with 2004s because of the integration of IP into Amerens operations, significant changes in capital structure, termination of certain of IPs former affiliate agreements, and new purchased power arrangements, among other factors. IPs cash from operations in 2005 benefited from lower taxes paid of $141 million, which resulted mostly from changes in taxable income and deferred tax benefits from accelerated depreciation resulting from the acquisition, and lower interest paid of $93 million. Negative impacts to IPs operating cash in 2005 included the absence of $128 million of interest received from IPs former affiliate, increased cash required for other operations and maintenance expenses of $59 million, and increased working capital investment. Significant drivers of the increase in working capital investment were colder weather and higher gas prices in December 2005, which increased receivables and gas inventories. IPs gas sales were up 45% over December 2004. Pension Funding Amerens 2004 and 2005 contributions to the defined benefit retirement plans qualified trusts, among other things, provide cost savings, because they mitigate future benefit cost increases. In addition, the contribution in 2004 allowed us to avoid paying a portion of the insurance premium to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Trust Corporation. Federal interest rate relief expired on December 31, 2005. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2006, and the new contribution requirements in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, in order to maintain minimum funding levels for Amerens pension plans, we do not expect future contributions to be required until 2009 at which time we would expect to contribute $100 million to $150 million. Required contributions of $150 million to $200 million each year are also expected for 2010 and 2011. We expect the companies to share the obligation: UE 61%; CIPS 10%; Genco 11%; CILCO 7%; and IP 11%. These amounts are estimates. They may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. See Note 10 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2006 versus 2005 Amerens increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to UEs 2006 purchases of a 640 megawatt CT facility from affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc., and 510 megawatt and 340 megawatt CT facilities from subsidiaries of Aquila, Inc., for a total of $292 million; increased nuclear fuel expenditures of $22 million; and $96 million of capital expenditures during 2006 related to the severe storms. The CT purchases are intended to meet UEs increased generating capacity needs and to provide UE with additional flexibility in determining the timing of future base load generating capacity additions. Emission allowance purchases decreased $50 million in 2006 compared with 2005, while emission allowance sales increased $49 million. The sale of noncore properties in 2006 provided a $56 million benefit to Amerens cash from investing activities as discussed below in the Sale of Noncore Properties section. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2006, compared with the same period in 2005, principally because of a decrease in capital expenditures at the Callaway nuclear plant. This is due to UE spending $221 million for planned upgrades during a scheduled refueling outage in 2005. In addition, in 2006 UE received $67 million from CIPS as repayment of an intercompany note. The cash effect of the $292 million in CT purchases discussed above was more than the prior year effect of the $237 million purchase of two CTs from Genco and the purchase of CT equipment from Development Company for $25 million. UEs capital expenditures related to the 2006 storms referenced above were $47 million. In 2006, UE had a $13 million gain on the sale of a noncore property, and a $35 million increase in sales of emission allowances. CIPS cash used in investing activities increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased $18 million. Also negatively impacting CIPS investing cash flow was an $18 million reduction in proceeds from CIPS note receivable from Genco in 2006 compared with 2005. In addition, CIPS paid $17 million to repurchase its own outstanding bond. The bond remains outstanding, and CIPS is currently the holder and debtor. The bond is expected to be redeemed in 2007. The increased capital expenditures resulted partly from CIPS expansion of its service territory because of its acquisition of UEs Illinois utility operations in May 2005. In addition, $16 million was expended as a result of storms. CIPS remaining capital expenditures were for projects to improve the reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. Genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006, compared with a net source of cash for 2005. This was due primarily to the 2005 sale of two CTs to UE for $241 million. Purchases of emission allowances were $45 million less in 2006 than in 2005. Capital expenditures increased $9 million for 2006 compared with 2005. CILCORPs cash used in investing activities decreased, and CILCOs increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased $12 million for CILCORP and CILCO, and net money pool advances decreased for each company by $42 million. CILCORPs cash from investing activities further benefited from the repayment of Resources Companys note payable of $71 million that originated from the 2005 transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to 52 Table of Contents Resources Company. In addition, a subsidiary of CILCORP and CILCO generated cash from investing activities of $11 million in 2006, from the sale of its remaining leveraged lease investments. Emission allowance purchases were $9 million less in 2006 than in 2005. IP had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006, compared with a net source of cash for 2005, primarily because of the absence in 2006 of proceeds in 2005 from repayments for advances made to the money pool in prior periods. In addition, capital expenditures increased $47 million over the year ago period, which included $27 million as a result of severe storms, and increased expenditures to maintain the reliability of IPs electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of future environmental capital investment estimates. Intercompany Transfer of Illinois Service Territory On May 2, 2005, UE completed the transfer of its Illinois based electric and natural gas service territory to CIPS, at a net book value of $133 million. UE transferred 50% of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $67 million and 50% of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. The remaining principal balance of $61 million under the note was repaid in full by CIPS in June 2006. Sale of Noncore Properties In 2006, Ameren, UE, CILCORP, and CILCO generated proceeds totaling $56 million (2005 $54 million), $13 million (2005 $ million), $11 million (2005 $13 million), and $11 million (2005 $13 million), respectively, from the sale of certain noncore properties, including leveraged leases. Prior to the 2005 leveraged lease sale, CILCORP transferred certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries that hold leveraged leases to Resources Company and AERG in exchange for a note receivable. Additionally, an indirect subsidiary of CILCORP that owned leveraged leases was transferred to AERG in exchange for a note receivable. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements, under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the noncore property sales. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren had a decrease in cash used in investing activities, primarily because of $429 million used to acquire IP in 2004. That decrease was partially offset by a $97 million increase in capital expenditures reflecting a full year of IP capital expenditures in 2005 compared with three months of IP expenditures in 2004, and the increased capital expenditures at UE discussed below. UEs cash used in investing activities increased in 2005, primarily because UE spent $237 million to purchase 550 megawatts of CTs from Genco and $25 million to purchase CT equipment from Development Company. Excluding these CT acquisitions, UEs capital expenditures in 2005 were consistent with those in 2004. UE maintained consistent plant expenditures by allocating fewer resources to projects at its coal fired plants as it spent $221 million of expenditures at its Callaway nuclear plant for upgrades during a refueling and maintenance outage. CIPS had a net use of cash in 2005 compared with net cash proceeds from investing activities in 2004, primarily because of an $18 million increase in capital expenditures and a $72 million reduction in cash received from principal payments on a note receivable from Genco. The increased capital expenditures were used to improve the reliability of CIPS transmission and distribution systems. Genco had a net source of cash in 2005, compared with a net use of cash from investing activities in 2004, primarily because of the sale of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois, to UE for $241 million. The benefit of these proceeds was reduced by increased capital expenditures for upgrades at one of its power plants in 2005 and by an increase in emission allowance purchases of $64 million. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because CILCORP and CILCO reduced capital expenditures and received proceeds of $13 million in 2005 from the sale of leveraged leases. In 2004, CILCOs subsidiary, AERG, made capital expenditures for significant power plant upgrades to increase fuel supply flexibility for power generation. The purchase of emission allowances negatively affected cash by $20 million more in 2005 than in 2004. IP had net proceeds of cash in 2005 and a net use of cash in 2004, primarily because of proceeds of $140 million for repayments of advances made to the money pool by IP in 2004. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: Capital Expenditures 2006 2005 2004 Ameren(a) $ 1,284 $ 935 $ 796 UE 782 775 514 CIPS 82 64 46 Genco 85 76 50 CILCORP 119 107 125 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 53 55 57 CILCO (AERG) 66 52 68 IP(b) 179 132 135 (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) The 2004 amounts include $100 million incurred prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. 53 Table of Contents Amerens 2006 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE purchased three CTs totaling $292 million. In addition, UE spent $40 million towards a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage expenditures of $47 million. CIPS and IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $16 million and $27 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG there was a cash outlay of $24 million and $11 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Genco also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of $16 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP. Amerens and UEs capital expenditures for 2005 principally consisted of $221 million for steam generators, low pressure rotor replacements, and other upgrades during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. Ameren and UE also incurred expenditures of $65 million for three CTs at UEs Venice plant, $60 million for numerous projects at UEs generating plants, and $45 million for various upgrades to its transmission and distribution system. In addition, UE incurred expenditures of $237 million for CTs purchased from Genco, as discussed above. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures included $29 million for ongoing generation plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. In addition, CILCO, CIPS, and IP incurred expenditures to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of their electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. Amerens capital expenditures for 2004 were made principally for various upgrades at UEs power plants, including the replacement of condenser bundles, and other upgrades during the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade work at UEs Callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of $40 million in 2004. In addition, UE incurred costs for steam generators and low pressure rotors that were replaced during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant. UE also incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its Venice plant and replacement of turbines at two of its power plants in 2004. In addition, UEs capital expenditures included environmental and other upgrades at its power plants and expenditures for new transmission and distribution lines. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily related to power plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. Gencos 2004 capital expenditures were primarily attributed to the replacement of a turbine generator at one of its power plants. Capital expenditures at IP and CIPS consisted of numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of their respective electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the systems. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2007 through 2011, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco, which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2007 2008 2011 Total UE $ 565 $ 2,000 $2,650 $ 2,565 $3,215 CIPS 75 290 390 365 465 Genco 195 830 1,120 1,025 1,315 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 60 190 250 250 310 CILCO (AERG) 195 240 320 435 515 IP 170 560 760 730 930 EEI 15 260 340 275 355 Other 25 130 170 155 195 Ameren(a) $ 1,300 $ 4,500 $6,000 $ 5,800 $7,300 (a) Includes amounts for nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution and generation related activities, as well as expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations discussed below. CIPS, CILCOs, and IPs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities and compliance with new environmental regulations. CILCO (AERG)s estimate includes capital expenditures for generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new environmental regulations at AERGs generating facilities. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in future years to comply with EPA and state regulations regarding SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal fired power plants. The EPA issued final SO2, NOx, and mercury emission regulations in May 2005. The rules require significant reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009. States were mandated to develop their own regulations as well. In February 2007, the Missouri Air Conservation Commission approved the proposed federal Clean Air Mercury and Clean Air Interstate rules, which substantially follow the federal rules. In December 2006, the Illinois Pollution Control Board adopted the mercury regulations, which are significantly stricter than the federal rules. Illinois has proposed rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule program; 54 Table of Contents however it is anticipated that the rules will not be finalized until the second quarter of 2007. The table below presents estimated capital costs based on current technology to comply with both (1) the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule through 2016, and (2) Illinois mercury regulations pursuant to an agreement between Genco, CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA. Under the agreement, Genco, CILCO and EEI may delay the compliance date for mercury reductions in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and SO2 controls. The agreement with the Illinois EPA also restricts purchasing SO2 and NOx emission allowances to meet specific allowed emission rates set forth in the agreement. The estimates described below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements, new technology, variations in costs of material or labor or alternative compliance strategies, among other reasons. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment. 2007 2008 2011 2012 2016 Total UE(a) $ 110 $ 630 830 $ 910 1,180 $1,650 2,120 Genco 110 820 1,060 180 260 1,110 1,430 AERG 100 185 240 95 140 380 480 EEI 10 185 240 165 220 360 470 Ameren $ 330 $1,820 $2,370 $1,350 $1,800 $3,500 $4,500 (a) UEs expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time. Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet the federal eight hour ozone ambient standard by June 2007 and the federal fine particulate ambient standard by April 2008. The costs in the table assume that emission controls required for the Clean Air Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet this new standard in the St. Louis region. Should Missouri develop an alternative plan to comply with this standard, the cost impact could be material to UE. Illinois is planning to impose additional requirements beyond the Clean Air Interstate Rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact state actions would have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2006 versus 2005 Ameren had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. Positive effects on cash included a net increase of $419 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2006, compared with net repayments of $224 million of short term debt in 2005 and a $454 million decrease in long term debt redemptions, repurchases and maturities. Negative effects on cash included a $411 million reduction in long term debt proceeds from the year ago period, and a $358 million reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. The reduction in common stock proceeds was due to the issuance of 7.4 million shares in the 2005 period related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in Amerens adjustable conversion rate equity security units. UE had a net use of cash used in financing activities in 2006, compared with a net source of cash in 2005. The absence of long term debt issuances in 2006, compared with $643 million of long term debt issuances in 2005, was the primary reason for the change, but this negative effect on cash flow was reduced by net changes in short term debt that resulted in a $154 million positive effect on cash in 2006, compared with a $295 million negative effect on cash in 2005. In addition, dividend payments decreased $31 million in the 2006 period from 2005, and net money pool borrowings increased $79 million. Cash from financing activities in 2006 was used principally to fund CT acquisitions. CIPS cash used in financing activities decreased in 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of the issuance of $61 million of long term debt that was used with other available corporate funds to repay CIPS outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable to UE. That note was originally issued as 50% of the consideration for UEs Illinois service territory, which was transferred to CIPS in 2005. Cash was also positively affected by a $64 million net decrease in money pool repayments and borrowings of $35 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility in 2006. A $15 million increase in dividends to Ameren negatively affected CIPS cash from financing activities in 2006, compared with the year ago period. Genco had a net decrease in cash used in financing activities for 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of $200 million of capital contributions received in 2006 from Ameren. These capital contributions were made to reduce Gencos money pool borrowings. In 2005, Genco used the $241 million from the sale of CTs to UE along with other funds to retire $225 million of maturing debt and to make principal payments on intercompany notes with CIPS and Ameren. Reducing these positive effects on cash was a $25 million increase in dividend payments in the 2006 period compared with the 2005 period. CILCORP had a net use of cash in 2006, compared with a net source of cash in 2005. CILCOs cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2006, compared with 2005. Net money pool repayments increased $142 million at CILCORP and $145 million at CILCO. CILCORPs net repayments of $113 million on its note payable to Ameren reduced its financing cash flow by $227 million compared with the year ago period, because 2005 included net borrowings on this note that provided CILCORP with cash. Positive effects on cash flow include long term debt issuances that generated $96 million in 2006, compared with no long term debt issuances in 2005. The proceeds from this debt were used to redeem $21 million of long term debt and to reduce money pool borrowings. In addition, CILCORP borrowed $215 million and CILCO (and CILCOs subsidiary 55 Table of Contents AERG) borrowed $165 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility, net of repayments. In 2006, CILCORP used cash of $33 million for redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt, compared with $101 million in the 2005 period. CILCOs cash used for redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt was comparable in the two years. These positive effects on cash in 2006 were partially offset by the absence in 2006 of a $102 million capital contribution received in 2005 from Ameren, which was made to reduce CILCOs short term debt. Also contributing to CILCORPs and CILCOs increase in cash used in financing activities for 2006, compared with 2005, were increased common stock dividends of $20 million at CILCORP and $45 million at CILCO. IP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. This was partly because of lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of $70 million. More debt was repaid in 2005 to improve IPs credit profile. Other positive effects on cash from financing activities included the absence in 2006 of $76 million of common stock dividend payments made in 2005, net borrowings of $75 million on the 2006 $500 million credit facility, and the issuance of $75 million of long term debt in 2006 compared with no long term debt proceeds in 2005. The $75 million was used to reduce money pool borrowings. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren had a net use of cash used for financing activities in 2005, compared with a net source of cash in 2004, primarily because of a $1 billion decrease in proceeds from common stock issuances in 2005 compared with 2004. The common stock proceeds in 2004 were principally used to fund the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI on September 30, 2004, and to repurchase and redeem certain IP indebtedness subsequent to the acquisition. In 2005, total common stock proceeds of $454 million included $345 million from the issuance of 7.4 million shares of common stock related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in Amerens adjustable conversion rate equity security units. The 2005 increase in cash used in financing activities was also attributable to $224 million of net redemptions of short term debt, compared with net proceeds of $256 million in 2004. Decreased long term debt redemptions of $847 million, increased long term debt issuances of $185 million, and the absence in 2005 of a $67 million UE nuclear fuel lease payment in 2004 partially offset the decrease in cash from financing activities in 2005. UE cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of a $374 million decrease in long term debt redemptions, a $239 million increase in issuances of long term debt, a $35 million decrease in the payment of dividends to Ameren, and the absence of a $67 million nuclear fuel lease payment that was made in 2004. These 2005 benefits in cash from financing activities were partially offset by $295 million used for short term debt repayments; in 2004, UE had net proceeds from short term debt. CIPS cash used in financing activities decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $40 million cash increase from reduced dividends paid to Ameren, and decreased long term debt redemptions of $50 million. These positive effects on cash were partially offset by decreased issuances of long term debt of $35 million and net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of $13 million. Gencos cash used in financing activities increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $225 million long term debt redemption in 2005 and increased payments of $30 million on its note payable to Ameren. The funds for these repayments came from the $241 million in proceeds from the 2005 sale of 550 megawatts of CTs to UE. Net cash used in financing activities also increased because of a capital contribution decrease of $72 million. A reduction of $72 million in payments on a note payable to CIPS and a net increase in non state regulated subsidiary money pool borrowings of $95 million, partially offset the additional uses of cash. Effective May 1, 2005, Genco and CIPS amended certain terms of Gencos subordinated affiliate note payable to CIPS by issuing to CIPS an amended and restated subordinated promissory note for $249 million with an interest rate of 7.125% per year, a five year amortization schedule, and a maturity of May 1, 2010. CILCORP and CILCO had a net source of cash in financing activities in 2005, compared with a net use of cash in 2004. For CILCORP, an $88 million increase in proceeds from an intercompany note payable to Ameren and from decreased long term debt redemptions of $41 million benefited cash. Reducing these increases were an increase in net repayments of money pool borrowings of $33 million and lower long term debt issuances of $19 million. CILCOs increase in cash from financing activities was mainly due to decreased long term debt redemptions of $103 million and increased capital contributions from Ameren of $27 million. Reducing these increases were increased net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of $36 million and increased dividend payments of $10 million. IP had a net use of cash in investing activities in 2005, compared with a net source of cash in 2004, primarily because 2004 included an $871 million capital contribution from Ameren. IPs $76 million increase in dividends to Ameren also contributed to IPs increase in cash used in financing activities. These negative effects on cash were reduced by lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of $732 million and by $75 million of cash received from utility money pool borrowings. Short term Borrowings and Liquidity Short term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities with maturities of 1 to 45 days. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of 56 Table of Contents this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of the Ameren Companies as of February 9, 2007, and the availability as of December 31, 2006: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren: Multiyear revolving(a)(b) July 2010 $ 1,150 $ 861 CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG: 2006 Multiyear revolving(c) January 2010 500 175 2007 Multiyear revolving(d) January 2010 500 (a) Ameren Companies may access this credit facility through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (b) See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for discussion of the amendment of this facility. (c) The maximum amount available to each borrower, including for issuance of letters of credit, is limited as follows: CIPS $135 million, CILCORP $50 million, CILCO $150 million, IP $150 million and AERG $200 million. Borrowings by CIPS, CILCO and IP under this facility are on a 364 day basis. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for discussion of this credit facility. (d) This credit facility was entered into on February 9, 2007. The maximum amount available to each borrower, including for the issuance of letters of credit, is limited as follows: CILCORP $125 million, IP $200 million and AERG $200 million. CIPS and CILCO have the option of permanently reducing their ability to borrow under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and shifting such capacity, up to the same limits, to the 2007 $500 million credit facility. CIPS, CILCOs and IPs participation in the 2007 $500 million credit facility is subject to appeal by the ICC. Borrowings by CIPS, CILCO and IP under this facility are on a 364 day basis. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of this credit facility. At December 31, 2006, Ameren and certain of its subsidiaries had $1.65 billion of committed credit facilities, consisting of two facilities as described below, in the amounts of $1.15 billion and $500 million. Ameren could directly borrow under the $1.15 billion facility up to the entire amount of the facility; UE could directly borrow under this facility up to $500 million on a 364 day basis; and Genco could directly borrow under this facility up to $150 million on a 364 day basis. This facility was also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing Company, AFS and Ameren Energy, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external short term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorization from the ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for Ameren from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006, Ameren had $137 million of cash and cash equivalents. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2006, FERC issued an order authorizing these subsidiaries to issue short term debt securities subject to the following limits on outstanding balances: UE $1 billion; CIPS $250 million; and CILCO $250 million. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2006, and terminates on March 31, 2008. IP has unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. Genco is authorized by FERC in its March 2006 order to have up to $300 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. AERG and EEI have unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. With the repeal of PUHCA 1935, the issuance of short term unsecured debt securities by Ameren and CILCORP, which was previously subject to SEC approval under PUHCA 1935, is no longer subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or other short term borrowing arrangements. 57 Table of Contents Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 for the Ameren Companies and EEI.

Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under certain of its 401(k) plans pursuant to effective SEC Form S 8 registration statements. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 1.9 million, ($96 million) shares of common stock in 2006, 2.1 million ($109 million) in 2005, and 2.3 million ($107 million) in 2004. Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions contained in our bank credit facilities and applicable cross default provisions. Also see Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2006, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit facility, indenture, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control, such as the legislation proposed to freeze electric rates at 2006 levels in Illinois for CIPS, CILCO and IP, may create 59 Table of Contents uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events would probably increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion. Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $522 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2006, $511 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2005, and $479 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2004. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 95% in 2006, 84% in 2005, and 90% in 2004. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 41% in 2006, 41% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the board considers various issues, including Amerens historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, projected cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics, and overall business considerations. On February 9, 2007, Amerens board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 30, 2007, to shareholders of record on March 7, 2007. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has common and preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met, or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2006, except as described below with respect to the 2006 $500 million credit facility, none of these conditions existed at the Ameren Companies. As a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. The restrictions on the ability of IP to declare and pay dividends on its common stock that were established by the ICC order approving Amerens acquisition of IP terminated in December 2006 with IPs redemption of the remaining $33,000 of its 11.50% series mortgage bonds due 2010. This ICC order also requires IP to establish a dividend policy comparable to that of Amerens other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%. On July 14, 2006, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, and AERG entered into a $500 million multiyear, senior secured credit facility (the 2006 $500 million credit facility). This facility limits CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to common and preferred stock dividend payments of $10 million per year each if CIPS, CILCOs or IPs senior secured long term debt securities or first mortgage bonds, or CILCORPs senior unsecured long term debt securities, get a below investment grade credit rating from either Moodys or S&P. With respect to AERG, which currently is not rated by Moodys or S&P, the common and preferred stock dividend restriction will not apply if its consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow ratio, pursuant to a calculation defined in the facilities, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1. On July 26, 2006, Moodys downgraded CILCORPs senior unsecured credit rating to below investment grade, causing it to be subject to this dividend payment limitation. As of December 31, 2006, AERG failed to meet the debt to operating cash flow ratio test in the 2006 $500 million credit facility. AERG therefore is currently limited in its ability to pay dividends to a maximum of $10 million per fiscal year. The other borrowers are not currently limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the 2006 $500 million credit facility. On February 9, 2007, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG entered into another $500 million multiyear senior secured credit facility (the 2007 $500 million credit facility) which contains identical provisions restricting the payment of dividends. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 60 Table of Contents The following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2006 2005 2004 UE $ 249 $ 280 $ 315 CIPS 50 35 75 Genco 113 88 66 CILCORP(a) 50 30 18 IP(b) 76 Nonregistrants 60 2 5 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 522 $ 511 $ 479 (a) CILCO paid to CILCORP dividends of $65 million, $20 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) Before October 2004, the ICC prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted, IPs dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova and indirectly to Dynegy. Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 9 Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances.

(g) Represents parent company only. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa1 BBB A Unsecured debt Baa1 BBB A Commercial paper P 2 A 3 F2 UE: Secured debt A2 BBB A+ Commercial paper P 2 A 3 F1 62 Table of Contents Moodys S&P Fitch CIPS: Secured debt Baa2 BBB A Genco: Unsecured debt Baa2 BBB BBB+ CILCORP: Unsecured debt Ba1 BB+ BBB+ CILCO: Secured debt Baa1 BBB A IP: Secured debt Baa2 BBB BBB On October 10, 2006, Moodys placed the long term credit ratings of Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP under review for possible downgrade, and affirmed the commercial paper ratings of Ameren and UE. Moodys had removed the review for possible downgrade in July 2006. According to Moodys, the review for possible downgrade was reinstituted because of concerns that the timely recovery of increased utility costs could be impaired by legislative action in Illinois, specifically the rate freeze legislation discussed in Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Moodys stated that enactment of the rate freeze legislation in Illinois would be expected to result in a multi notch downgrade of the ratings of CIPS, CILCO and IP to speculative (sub investment) grade, reflecting the severe impact such action would have on the utilities cash flow and liquidity. Moodys has also indicated that if legislation freezing rates at 2006 levels, or similar legislation that restricts the recovery of costs in a timely manner, becomes a substantial possibility, it may consider additional credit ratings downgrades with regard to one or more of the Ameren Companies. On October 10, 2006, Fitch placed the credit ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP on rating watch negative. The ratings of UE and Genco were affirmed and not affected by these rating actions. The negative rating watch resulted from the heightened political rhetoric surrounding future utility rates in Illinois and uncertainty related to recovery of CIPS, CILCORPs, CILCOs and IPs purchased power costs. On October 5, 2006, S&P, in reaction to the intensified political discussion in Illinois regarding possible legislation freezing rates at 2006 levels, downgraded the credit ratings of the Ameren Companies. As a result of S&Ps downgrade of Amerens and UEs short term ratings to A 3, Ameren and UE are currently limited in their access to the commercial paper market. All of the S&P credit ratings for the Ameren Companies remain on credit watch with negative implications. According to S&P, it will continue to lower the Ameren Companies credit ratings if, in its opinion, the likelihood of Illinois legislation freezing electric rates at 2006 levels increases. If the legislation is passed, S&P will lower ratings on CIPS, CILCO, CILCORP and IP to B a deep junk or speculative credit rating category. Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital. It may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. For example, if at December 31, 2006, the Ameren Companies had a sub investment grade rating (less than BBB or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO or IP could have been required to post collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $236 million, $43 million, $22 million, $21 million, $40 million, $40 million, or $72 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. Suppliers may request prepayment for products and services. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2007 and beyond. Revenues In 2006, electric rate freezes or adjustment moratoriums and power supply contracts expired in Amerens regulatory jurisdictions. At the end of 2006, electric rates for Amerens operating subsidiaries had been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 15 years to 25 years. In January 2006, the ICC approved a framework for CIPS, CILCO and IP to procure power for use by their customers through an auction. It also approved the related tariffs to collect these costs from customers for the period commencing January 2, 2007. This approval is subject to pending court appeals. In September 2006, the power procurement auction was held and declared successful with respect to power for fixed price customers, the vast majority of electric customers of CIPS, CILCO and IP. The auction clearing price was about $65 per megawatthour for the fixed price residential and small commercial product and about $85 per megawatthour for large commercial and industrial customers. Marketing Company participated in the auction with power being acquired from Genco and AERG, subject to an auction rules limitation of providing no more than 35% of the Ameren Illinois Utilities expected annual load, and it was awarded sales in the auction. As a result of the high auction price for the large commercial and industrial customers, almost all of these customers chose a different supplier. In 2006, the Non rate regulated Generation segment generated 30 million megawatthours of power (Genco 15 million, AERG 7 million, EEI 8 million). Power previously supplied by Genco to CIPS and by AERG to CILCO was subject to below market priced contracts that expired on December 31, 2006. All but 5 million megawatthours of Gencos pre 2006 wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements also expired during 2006. About 1 million megawatthours of these 63 Table of Contents contracts expire by the end of 2007 and another 2 million expire by the end of 2008. Substantially all of these contracts involved below market prices. These agreements had an average embedded selling price of $36 per megawatthour. In 2006, Genco also sold 2.1 million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at an average market price of $38 per megawatthour. In 2006, AERGs power was sold principally to CILCO, at an average price of $32 per megawatthour. In addition, AERG sold 1.5 million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at an average price of $37 per megawatthour in 2006. The Non rate regulated Generation segment expects to generate 32 million megawatthours of power in 2007 (Genco 17 million, AERG 7 million, EEI 8 million). Genco, AERG and EEI have contracts to sell all their power to Marketing Company. Marketing Company will resell this power and provide the net proceeds to Genco and AERG. The marketing strategy for Non rate regulated Generation is to optimize our generation output in a low risk manner to minimize earnings and cash flows volatility, while capitalizing on our low cost generation fleet to provide for solid, sustainable returns. Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, and the Illinois 2006 power procurement auction, Non rate regulated Generation has sold approximately 90% of its expected 2007 generation output (29 million megawatthours) at an average price of $51 per megawatthour. Expected sales in 2007 include an estimated 7.6 million megawatthours of power sold through the Illinois power procurement auction at about $65 per megawatthour (2008 6.8 million, 2009 4.3 million). Including auction sales, approximately 55% of the expected generation output in 2008 is sold. CIPS, CILCO and IP filed rate cases with the ICC in December 2005 to modify their electric delivery service rates effective January 2, 2007. CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by $202 million in the aggregate (CIPS $14 million, CILCO $43 million and IP $145 million). In November 2006, the ICC issued an order approving an annual revenue increase for electric delivery service of $97 million in the aggregate (CIPS $8 million decrease, CILCO $21 million increase and IP $84 million increase) based on an allowed return on equity of 10%. In December 2006, the ICC granted the Ameren Illinois Utilities petition for rehearing of the November 2006 order on the recovery of certain administrative and general expenses, totaling approximately $50 million, that were disallowed. Because of the ICCs cost disallowances and regulatory lag, the Ameren Illinois Utilities are not expected to earn their allowed return on equity in 2007. Prior to January 2, 2007, most customers were taking service under a frozen bundled electric rate in 2006, which included the cost of power, so any delivery service revenue changes will not directly correspond to a change in CIPS, CILCOs or IPs revenues or earnings under the new electric delivery service rates. The necessity and timing of new Illinois delivery service rate cases for the Ameren Illinois Utilities will be driven by several factors, including the results of the pending rehearing. Average residential electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP increased significantly following the expiration of a rate freeze at the end of 2006. Electric rates rose because of the increased cost of power purchased on behalf of Ameren Illinois Utilities customers based on the results of the Illinois power procurement auction held in early September 2006 and increases resulting from the delivery service rate cases. CIPS and IP average residential rates are expected to increase in 2007 by approximately 40% over 2006 rates, and CILCO average residential rates are expected to increase approximately 55% over 2006 rates. Due to the magnitude of these increases, certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the Illinois governor and other parties sought to block the power procurement auction. They continue to challenge the auction and the structure for the recovery of costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates to customers. CIPS, CILCO and IP have received favorable rulings from the ICC and the circuit court of Cook County, Illinois on opposition claims filed by the Illinois attorney general, CUB and ELPC. These rulings are currently under court appeals. On October 2, 2006, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives Michael Madigan sent a letter to Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich asking the Illinois governor to call a special session of the Illinois General Assembly to consider legislation to freeze electric rates at 2006 levels. The governor sent a letter indicating that once the votes to pass the legislation were in place, he would immediately call for a special session of the legislature. The governors letter further provided that if a consensus among members of the general assembly could not be reached in the near future, he would call a special session in that event as well. No special session was called. The governors letter stated that he continued to support legislation extending a rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as possible. During the Illinois General Assemblys session that ended in January 2007, the Illinois House of Representatives passed legislation to freeze 2006 electric rates through 2010, and the Illinois Senate passed legislation containing a rate increase phase in plan. The Illinois Senate bill provided for a mandatory phase in of the 2007 increase in residential rates over a three year period. Neither piece of legislation was passed by the other chamber before the session ended in early January 2007. Any legislative measure will need to be approved by the Illinois House of Representatives and Illinois Senate, and signed by the governor before it can become law. A new Illinois General Assembly went into session in late January 2007. As a result, all previous bills expired. New bills have been introduced during the current legislative session, including legislation to rollback rates to 2006 levels similar to previously proposed legislation. 64 Table of Contents CIPS, CILCO and IP believe that legislation freezing electric rates at 2006 levels, if enacted, would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, including the financial insolvency of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP. They believe it could cause significant job losses and, without governmental intervention, significant disruptions in electric and gas service. Amerens Illinois utilities own no generation, so the companies must purchase power on the competitive market to meet their customers energy needs. If electric rates were frozen at 2006 levels, the major credit rating agencies have stated that the Ameren Illinois Utilities credit ratings would be downgraded to deep junk (or speculative) status. Such a downgrade of CILCOs ratings would also result in a similar downgrade of CILCORPs ratings. With such credit ratings, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP would be faced with potential collateral and prepayment requirements for products and services, such as natural gas, and would run out of cash and available credit and be unable to borrow. We believe this would cause the Ameren Illinois Utilities to become financially insolvent. Any decision or action that impairs the ability of CIPS, CILCO, and IP to fully recover costs from their electric customers in a timely manner would result in material adverse consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP. CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to take whatever actions are necessary to protect their financial interests, including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts. In December 2006, the ICC approved a constructive electric rate increase phase in plan proposed by the Ameren Illinois Utilities for residential customers, eligible schools, local governments and small commercial customers, to address the significant increases in customer rates for the Ameren Illinois Utilities beginning in 2007. This optional plan limits annual rate increases to 14% in 2007, 2008, and 2009, with amounts in excess of the cap and a 3.25% carrying cost allowed to be collected over a three year period beginning in 2010. This below market carrying cost charge will result in increased net borrowing and financing costs for the Ameren Illinois Utilities. On February 27, 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities announced that they intended to file an electric rate increase mitigation plan with the ICC. As part of the plan, which is subject to ICC approval, the Ameren Illinois Utilities would fund an approximate $20 million one time reduction to active residential accounts that would appear on electric bills in March and April 2007. The rate mitigation plan is targeted to customers with high volume usage. As part of the filing, the carrying charge of 3.25% in the current ICC approved phase in plan would be eliminated. If approved by the ICC, the one time credit for residential customers would result in a charge to Amerens earnings in 2007 of $20 million, or 6 cents per share. In addition, eliminating the below market interest rate on deferred amounts under the phase in plan would increase financing costs for the Ameren Illinois Utilities during the deferral period. The actual cost to Ameren will depend on the level of participation in the phase in plan. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of Illinois rate matters. The Illinois General Assembly and the ICC may consider changes to the Illinois power procurement process in the future. The next Illinois power procurement auction for the Ameren Illinois Utilities is scheduled to take place in January 2008. In July 2006, UE filed requests with the MoPSC for an increase in electric rates of $361 million and in natural gas delivery rates of $11 million. The MoPSC staff recommended in their testimony an electric rate reduction of $136 million to $168 million and a gas rate increase of $2 million to $3 million. Other stakeholders also made recommendations. A decision from the MoPSC is expected no later than June 2007. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of Missouri rate matters. We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit energy demand in 2007 and beyond, but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers, especially in Illinois. UE, Genco and CILCO are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants through greater investments and a process improvement program and investment. Very volatile power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of revenues Ameren, UE, Genco and CILCO (through AERG) can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and interchange markets and influence the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets. These companies hedged approximately 86% of estimated available 2007 generation (2008 70%, 2009 60%). Fuel and Purchased Power In 2006, 85% of Amerens electric generation (UE 77%, Genco 97%, CILCO 99%) was supplied by its coal fired power plants. About 93% of the coal used by these plants (UE 97%, Genco 87%, CILCO 69%) was delivered by railroads from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In 2005, deliveries from the Powder River Basin were restricted due to derailments. As of December 31, 2006, coal inventories for UE, Genco and AERG were adequate, and consistent with historical levels. However, inventories and deliveries were still below desired levels because of railroad capacity limitations. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco and CILCO to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources. Amerens coal and related transportation costs are expected to increase 15% to 20% in 2007 and 5% to 10% in 2008. Amerens nuclear fuel costs are also expected to rise over the next few years. In 2007, nuclear fuel costs are expected to increase 13% to 65 Table of Contents 18%. In addition, power generation from higher cost gas fired plants is expected to increase in the next few years. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report for information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2006 through 2010. In Illinois, Ameren and IP will also experience higher year over year purchased power expenses as the amortization of certain favorable purchase accounting adjustments associated with the IP acquisition was completed in 2006. In July 2005, a new law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to put in place fuel, purchased power, and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouris utilities. The law also includes rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate increase cap for the environmental cost recovery mechanism, and prudency reviews, among other things. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. We are unable to predict when rules implementing the environmental cost recovery mechanism will be formally proposed and adopted. UE requested a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed with the MoPSC in July 2006. The MoPSC staff and intervenors in the electric rate case have recommended that UE not be granted the right to use such a mechanism. UE also requested an environmental cost recovery mechanism as part of its pending Missouri electric case, but no rules have been established for such a mechanism. UEs requests are subject to approval by the MoPSC. In 2007, Ameren expects to reduce levels of emission allowance sales in order to retain remaining allowances for future environmental compliance needs. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. Until reviews conducted by state authorities have concluded, litigation has been resolved, the insurance review is completed, a final decision about whether the plant will be rebuilt is made, and future regulatory treatment for the plant is determined, Taum Sauk will remain out of service. In February 2007, UE submitted plans and an environmental report to FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk plant, assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with authorities of the state of Missouri. Should the decision be made to rebuild the Taum Sauk plant, UE would expect it to be out of service through at least the middle of 2009, if not longer. UE has accepted responsibility for the effects of the incident. At this time, UE believes that substantially all of the damage and liabilities (but not penalties) caused by the breach, including rebuilding the plant, will be covered by insurance. UE expects the total cost for clean up, damage and liabilities, excluding costs to rebuild the facility, resulting from the Taum Sauk incident to range from $131 million to $151 million. As of December 31, 2006, UE had paid $65 million and accrued a $66 million liability, including costs resulting from the FERC stipulation and consent agreement, while expensing $30 million, and recording a $101 million receivable due from insurance companies. As of December 31, 2006, UE had received $16 million from insurance companies reducing the insurance receivable to $85 million. As of December 31, 2006, UE had a $10 million receivable due from insurance companies related to rebuilding the facility. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. As a result of this breach, UE is subject to litigation by private parties and by state authorities. We are unable to determine the impact the breach may have on Amerens and UEs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in 2007 is expected to last 30 to 35 days. During an outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, versus non outage years. Over the next few years, we except rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken, or may need to take, at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities. Insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the Taum Sauk incident, among other things. Bad debts may increase due to rising electric rates. We are currently undertaking cost reduction and control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of all aspects of our business. Capital Expenditures The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2007 and 2016, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. These investments will also result in significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 50% of this investment will be in Amerens regulated UE operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of this increased investment. Ameren will provide a report on how it is responding to rising regulatory, competitive, and public pressure to significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from current and proposed power plant operations. The report will include Amerens climate change strategy and activities, current greenhouse gas emissions, and analysis with respect to plausible future greenhouse gas 66 Table of Contents scenarios. Ameren will publish this report on its Web site by September 1, 2007. Investments to control carbon emissions at Amerens coal fired plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. At this time, UE does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until at least 2018. However, due to the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for and build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future plant alternatives, including those that would use coal or nuclear power. Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve overall system reliability in addition to addressing environmental compliance requirements. We are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures. Other Severe storms in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in electric outages for more than 1.5 million customers and an increased focus on alternatives for improving reliability during severe storms. UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs performance during these storms is subject to regulatory and legislative review and media attention. Recommendations to improve service during severe storms resulting from regulatory and internal reviews could include more aggressive tree removal and trimming programs, comprehensive pole and line inspections and burial of more electric services, among other things. Any additional costs or investments would be expected to be recovered in rates. In 2006, Ameren realized gains on sales of noncore properties, including leveraged leases. The net benefit of these sales to Ameren in 2006 was 16 cents per share. Ameren continues to pursue the sale of its interests in its remaining three leveraged lease assets. Ameren does not expect to achieve similar sales levels of noncore properties in 2007. Affiliate Transactions As a result of the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006, UE and Genco no longer have the obligation to provide power to each other. UE will be able to sell any excess power it has at market prices, which we believe will most likely be higher than it was paid by Genco. Genco will no longer receive the margins on sales that it made, which were fulfilled with power from UE. Amerens and UEs earnings will be affected by the termination of the JDA when UEs rates are adjusted by the MoPSC. UEs requested electric rate increase filed in July 2006 is net of the decrease in its revenue requirement from increased margins expected to result from the termination of the JDA. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the effects of terminating the JDA. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 67 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is probably no longer recoverable, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for quantification of these assets by registrant. Environmental Costs We accrue for all known environmental contamination where remediation can be reasonably estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over 100 years and previous contamination may be unknown to us. Extent of contamination Responsible party determination Approved methods for cleanup Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination by using internal and third party estimates of cleanup costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for disclosure on quantified environmental costs, to the extent possible. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we project expected usage, and we estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery 68 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See balance sheets under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts for each registrant. Valuation of Goodwill, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use internal models and third parties to determine fair values. We use various methods to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our goodwill assets. Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 158, which provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 10 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Basis for Judgment We use a third party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 10 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Our Missouri retail electric rates and gas delivery rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of Missouri electric and gas rate cases. In July 2006, UE filed a request with the MoPSC for an increase in base rates for electric service and in natural gas delivery rates. A decision from the MoPSC is expected no later than June 2007. Our Illinois electric rates were legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007. Even without these rate moratoriums, adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. 69 Table of Contents The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. The generation portion of our business in Illinois is non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms. In UEs Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there is currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. However, in July 2005, a new law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to put in place fuel, purchased power, and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouris utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. UE requested a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed with the MoPSC in July 2006. UE also requested an environmental cost recovery mechanism as part of its pending Missouri electric case, but rules have not been established for such a mechanism. UEs requests are subject to approval by the MoPSC. Effective January 2, 2007, ICC approved tariffs in Illinois allow CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover power supply costs by adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on legislative and other efforts to limit full recovery of power costs in Illinois. In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE, Genco, CILCORP and AERG are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report for further information. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; commercial paper; and auction rate long term debt. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 14 $ (9 ) UE 7 (5 ) CIPS 1 (b ) Genco 1 (1 ) CILCORP 3 (2 ) CILCO 2 (1 ) IP 5 (3 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and 70 Table of Contents executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2006, no nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, CIPS, Genco, AERG, IP, AFS and Marketing Company may have credit exposure associated with interchange purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2006, UEs, CIPS, Gencos, AERGs, IPs, AFS and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange purchases and sales was less than $1 million, net of collateral (2005 $39 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market to be $35 million at December 31, 2006 (2005 $26 million). Equity Price Risk Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income or OCI and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2006, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%) and debt securities (32%) and totaled $285 million (2005 $250 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results, through electric rates. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas. UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies, which include structured forward hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for generation. Most UE, Genco and AERG fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. UE, Genco and AERG do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric operations, so UE, Genco and AERG have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. As part of its pending electric 71 Table of Contents rate case filed in July 2006, UE has requested approval by the MoPSC for a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism to its tariffs. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas transportation expenses for the distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units are controlled by FERC via published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year to year. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our requirements. The following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2007 through 2011: Coal Transportation Fuel Net Fuel Net Expense Income(a) Expense Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 18 $ (11 ) $ 16 $ (10 ) UE 8 (5 ) 5 (3 ) Genco 6 (3 ) 6 (3 ) CILCORP 2 (1 ) 2 (1 ) CILCO 2 (1 ) 2 (1 ) EEI 2 (1 ) 2 (1 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements, or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge. Fuel assemblies for the 2007 spring refueling are already at the Callaway nuclear plant. UE has price hedges for 61% of the 2008 to 2011 nuclear fuel requirements. The nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change; from a buyers market to a sellers market with increased potential for supply disruptions. UE has increased its desired inventories of nuclear fuel (with inherent price hedge) and has increased its forward contract coverage. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component. Therefore, nuclear fuel price increases are expected and price hedging becomes less available. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if available. With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run the CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs natural gas distribution business and CIPS, CILCOs and IPs power and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs. Our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers. We cannot eliminate the effects of price volatility. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability. 72 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP, which own no generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2007 through 2011: 2007 2008 2009 2011 Ameren: Coal 100 % 94 % 41 % Coal transportation 97 90 41 Nuclear fuel 100 91 51 Natural gas for generation 61 8 2 Natural gas for distribution(a) 85 18 9 Purchased power for Illinois Regulated(b) 100 81 20 UE: Coal 100 % 93 % 41 % Coal transportation 100 97 61 Nuclear fuel 100 91 51 Natural gas for generation 39 3 Natural gas for distribution(a) 94 18 7 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(a) 100 % 32 % 15 % Purchased power(b) 100 81 20 Genco: Coal 100 % 96 % 38 % Coal transportation 96 74 25 Natural gas for generation 100 19 4 CILCORP/CILCO: Coal (AERG) 100 % 95 % 42 % Coal transportation (AERG) 79 70 23 Natural gas for distribution(a) 78 17 14 Purchased power(b) 100 81 20 IP: Natural gas for distribution(a) 76 % 14 % 8 % Purchased power(b) 100 81 20 EEI: Coal 100 % 95 % 43 % Coal transportation 100 100 (a) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for the peak winter season of November through March. The year 2007 represents the period January 2007 through March 2007. The year 2008 represents November 2007 through March 2008. This continues each successive year through March 2011. (b) Represents the percentage of purchased power price hedged for fixed price residential and small commercial customers with less than 1 megawatt of demand as part of the Illinois power procurement auction held in September 2006. Excluded from the percent hedged amount is purchased power for fixed price large commercial and industrial customers with 1 megawatt of demand or higher who had 30 to 50 days after the date the auction was declared successful (September 15, 2006) to elect not to receive power from CIPS, CILCO or IP. The majority of these customers chose a third party supplier. However, regardless of whether customers choose a third party supplier, the purchased power needed to serve the remaining load is 100% price hedged through May 31, 2008, due to the Illinois auction. Also excluded from the percent hedged amount is power purchased to serve large service real time pricing customers, as the auction results have not been finalized for this customer class. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil. Also see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission allowances. 73 Table of Contents Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity may cause any of these conditions: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment; or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 8 Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2006. The sources used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes, other external sources, and other modeling and valuation methods. All of these contracts have maturities of less than three years.
