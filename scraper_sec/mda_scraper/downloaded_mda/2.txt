ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL In recent years, the Company has undergone an extensive restructuring of its operations with the objective of improving its competitive position within the durable medical equipment industry. The restructuring was designed to reduce costs and the eliminate excess manufacturing capacity. Asset sales were undertaken to generate cash to partially finance restructuring activities and reduce debt levels. Credit facilities were modified or expanded as needed to partially fund the overall restructuring, in addition to contributing to the funding of the Companys operations. In early 1992 the Company announced its intention to consolidate its domestic wheelchair manufacturing operations and corporate headquarters by relocating its California based manufacturing and corporate offices to Missouri by the end of 1992. This decision was made to further reduce costs through the consolidation of administrative and support functions with existing operations in Missouri. The relocation from California was begun in the second quarter of 1992, and, except for data processing operations, was largely completed by the end of 1992. In October, 1993, the Company transferred its data processing operations from California to Missouri, which represented the final step in the Companys relocation. As a result of the relocation, the Company experienced major start up problems in wheelchair production and manufacturing delays and inefficiencies attributable generally to the commencement of relocated manufacturing operations and specifically to the need to train a large number of new employees. These start up problems impacted most severely the Companys high margin rehab wheelchair products, and the resulting reduction in sales and cash flow hindered the Companys ability to keep vendor payments current and to otherwise implement corrective measures quickly and effectively. Shipment delays caused a substantial build up in back ordered power and rehab wheelchair products in the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, which the Company reduced over time. Customer confidence and frustration resulting from such delays combined to increase the order cancellation rate and to decrease the incoming order rate, particularly for the affected wheelchairs. As a result, orders and market share decreased, and manufacturing activity generally shifted disproportionately to lower margin commodity wheelchairs. Incoming orders, product backlog and timely shipments were improved during the second half of 1993, with continued improvement during 1994 and 1995. However, the Company believes order rates, margins and market share must continue to improve and customer confidence must be further restored and reinforced if the Company is to generate the cash flow necessary to fund its operations on a continuing basis and to achieve profitability. Additionally, certain production rationalizations are in process relative to the Companys manufacturing facilities in the US, Canada and Mexico, which are designed to improve the Companys operating efficiencies and cost structure by reducing duplicate overhead costs. Production and delivery of all of the Companys homecare bed products were unaffected by the production problems that occurred in the relocation of the wheelchair manufacturing facility to St. Louis. The Company has continued to deliver homecare bed products in a timely manner and management believes that market share can be maintained in these product lines. The sale of the Institutional Business has not adversely affected homecare bed sales. Effective in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of Smith & Davis hospital and nursing home bed and institutional casegoods businesses (the "Institutional Business") and recorded a reserve of $13 million to write down the assets of the Institutional Business to their estimated net realizable values and for the estimated operating losses during the phase out period and the estimated costs of disposition. See Note 2 Restructuring Expenses, and Note 4 Assets Held for Sale, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. By Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. In the domestic market, the Companys durable medical equipment products are sold primarily through homecare and medical equipment dealers, as well as national accounts. Consumers and dealers are reimbursed through federal, state and private insurer reimbursement programs. The Company recognizes the need to counteract the impact of cutbacks in such programs on its results of operations and cash flow through the benefits of a reduced cost structure and by targeting new market segments. During fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company required approximately $2.6 million (net), $13.7 million and $45.8 million, respectively, of additional financing from BIL to fund its operating requirements and accrued restructuring expenses, and the amount of outstanding advances owing to BIL at December 31, 1995 totaled $21.1 million (see Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion and Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K). In 1994, based on predominant industry practice, the Company changed its method of classification of shipping and distribution costs in the statement of operations. Such costs are now presented in cost of sales versus operating expenses in prior years. For purposes of the following discussion of results of operations, affected amounts for all years have been reclassified to conform to the current years classification. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Substantially all of the Companys revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 1995 were from products manufactured in North America. 1995 versus 1994 Revenues in 1995 decreased $4.8 million, or 6%, versus 1994, primarily due to increased price competition related to the increased market penetration of managed care organizations and price constraints established by the US Government for Medicare reimbursement. Wheelchair sales were adversely affected by competition as the Companys competitors attempted to maximize market share. Lower homecare bed revenues reflect the impact of increased price competition. 1994 versus 1993 Revenues in 1994 declined $15 million, or 16% versus 1993, due primarily to the exclusion of the Institutional Business. Revenues of the Institutional Business and related costs were included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in 1993 but not 1994 or 1995, as the related assets were classified as held for sale at December 31, 1993, and the 1994 and 1995 results of operations were aggregated and charged against accrued restructuring expenses for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. If the 1994 revenues of the Institutional Business ($21.2 million) had been included in the Consolidated results for 1994, revenues would have been increased by $6.2 million or 7%. 1993 wheelchair sales and operations were negatively impacted by the relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri. Delivery delays caused by the 1992 move have decreased and lead times have now been brought more in line with historical levels. Operating Results For the periods indicated, the following table summarizes operating results of the Company (dollars in millions): Year Ended December31, 1995 1994 1993 Amount % Amount % Amount % Revenues $74.6 100 $79.4 100 $94.5 100 Cost of sales 58.6 79 65.8 83 83.8 89 Gross profit 16.0 21 13.6 17 10.7 11 Operating expenses 17.6 23 20.8 26 46.0 48 Operating loss before restructuring expenses (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (35.3) (37) Restructuring expenses 15.1 16 Operating loss (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (50.4) (53) Interest expense, BIL (1.7) (2) (0.9) (1) (2.6) (3) Interest expense, other (2.1) (3) (1.7) (2) (2.5) (3) Loss before income taxes (5.4) (7) (9.9)(12) (55.5) (59) Income tax provisions (benefits) 0.1 (0.1) .2 Net loss $(5.5) (7) $(9.8)(12) $(55.7) (59) 1995 versus 1994 1995 revenues decreased $4.8 million or 6% to $74.6 million from $79.4 million in 1994. Wheelchair and accessory sales of $59.7 million in 1995 decreased $4.0 million or 6% from 1994. Price pressure brought on by competition, managed care and government cutbacks negatively impacted domestic sales. The decrease is due primarily to discounting in the marketplace. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds in 1995 increased $1.1 million or 12% from 1994. 1995 sales of Smith & Davis oxygen concentrators and other products decreased $1.9 million as this product line was discontinued and sold in August 1995. Total Company gross profit increased $2.4 million or 18% from $13.6 million in 1994 to $16.0 million in 1995. The increase in gross profit reflects improved manufacturing efficiency and positive results of the Companys program to outsource manufacturing to lower cost facilities, offset in part by continued price competition in the markets for the Companys wheelchairs and bed products. Productivity at the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 1995 as a result of a WARN act notice issued pursuant to the layoff of 30% of the work force at that facility. These layoffs, which were completed during the first quarter of 1996, were a result of the transfer of workload to lower cost facilities and the Companys continued manufacturing rationalization. Operating expenses decreased $3.2 million from $20.8 million in 1994 to $17.6 million in 1995. This decrease is primarily due to continued cost containment and favorable changes in insurance rates and claims. Interest expense increased to $3.8 million in 1995 from $2.6 million in 1994 due to increased borrowings during 1995. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes, and Note 7 Debt, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 1994 versus 1993 Wheelchair and accessory sales of $65.7 million in 1994 increased $3.9 million or 6% from 1993. The 1992 relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri and the related production and delivery problems negatively affected sales during 1993. Shipments during 1993 were further negatively impacted by complications arising out of a major computer system implementation which occurred in October, 1993. The majority of the problems associated with the computer system conversion have since been rectified. The domestic wheelchair order rate demonstrated improvement throughout 1994 as operations in Missouri stabilized. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds of $10.7 million in 1994 decreased $0.7 million or 6% from 1993 due primarily to increased competition and price erosion. Sales of the Institutional Business for 1993 approximated $17 million. This business was not included in the Companys consolidated results of operations for 1994 or 1995, as discussed above. Total Company gross profit increased $2.9 million or 27% from $10.7 million in 1993 to $13.6 million in 1994. The increase in gross profit reflected manufacturing efficiencies experienced in the wheelchair operations as operations stabilized subsequent to the 1992 relocation of wheelchair manufacturing to Missouri. Gross profit was adversely affected during the fourth quarter of 1994 by a $3.0 million charge to reserves for product liability, workers compensation claims and inventory cost adjustments. As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased from 11% in 1993 to 17% in 1994. Operating expenses decreased $25.2 million from $46.0 million in 1993 to $20.8 million in 1994. This decrease is primarily due to a $9.7 million charge relating to in process research and development expenses (selling expenses) recorded during 1993 pursuant to the Companys acquisition of Medical Composite Technology, Inc., a $2.0 million charge recorded during 1993 for anticipated costs of environmental remediation, and a $2.4 million charge recorded during 1993 for severance obligations and other cost reductions implemented during 1994. Additionally, during 1994 $1.7 million was charged to restructuring reserves relating to General and Administrative expenses allocated to the Institutional Business. Restructuring expenses recorded during 1993 of $15.1 million primarily relate to losses anticipated on the disposition of the Companys Institutional Business. Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in 1994 from $5.1 million in 1993 due primarily to the fourth quarter 1993 conversion of $75 million of debt and accrued interest to equity. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash provided from operations and borrowings. At December 31, 1995, the Company had $0.1 million in cash or $0.4 million less than the $0.5 million in cash at December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1995, total debt of $47.9 million was $5.3 million higher than the $42.6 million in debt at December 31, 1994. The debt conversion transaction in 1993 resulted in conversion of $75 million of indebtedness and accrued interest to $55 million of Common Stock and $20 million of Series C Preferred Stock. Prior to such debt conversion transaction, the indebtedness had increased during 1993 due to advances from BIL in the amount of $37.8 million, which were used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses and to repay $5.7 million to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited Chicago Branch ("HSBC"). During 1994 and 1995 BIL advanced the Company an additional $13.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, which was used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses. In December 1995, HSBC and E&J Inc. agreed to amend the Revolving Credit Agreement originally entered into on September 30, 1992 and extend its term through September, 1997. The HSBC facility, as amended, provides up to $6 million of letter of credit availability and cash advances of up to $25 million to E&J Inc. Advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.25%, as announced by Marine Midland Bank N.A., from time to time, and are guaranteed by Brierley Investments Limited, an affiliate of BIL. Repayment of existing debt with BIL is subordinated to the HSBC debt. On December 21, 1995, $3 million of the increased credit facility was utilized to repay an advance from BIL made earlier in 1995. As of December 31, 1995, $18.7 million of the $25 million available for cash advances from HSBC had been utilized. At December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, under the debt agreements with BIL and HSBC, the Company was obligated to repay the following amounts at the various dates listed below. 12/31/95 12/31/94 Balance Balance Debt Agreement $ millions $ millions Repayment Date Revolving Promissory 21.1 18.5 Revolving Promissory Note Note to BIL matures September 30, 1997 HSBC Revolving Credit 18.7 10.0 September 30, 1997 Agreement (1) Accrued, unpaid 2.6 1.0 interest due BIL TOTAL $42.4 $29.5 (1)Excludes approximately $5.7 million and $5.1 million committed with respect to outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Companys operation will produce positive cash flow in sufficient amounts so that the Company will be able to secure additional borrowings or make asset sales that will enable it to make its debt payments when due. The Company entered into a debt conversion agreement as of September 30, 1993 with BIL whereby $75 million of the indebtedness due BIL was restructured by the issuance of a Common Stock Note and a Preferred Stock Note. The balance of the BIL indebtedness ($6.8 million) which was not converted into the Common Stock Note and the Preferred Stock Note was treated as advances under the the Companys revolving promissory note with BIL. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the debt conversion transaction. BIL agreed, upon stockholder approval of the debt conversion transaction and related recapitalization proposals, to advance to E&J Inc. an additional $10 million. Such advance by BIL to E&J Inc. resulted in an increase in the principal amount of the Common Stock Note from $45 million to $55 million and a decrease in the balance of BILs revolving promissory note to $4.8 million effective as of December 31, 1993. As part of the debt conversion transaction, BIL agreed to provide to the Company and E&J Inc. a revolving credit facility of up to $12.5 million, as evidenced by BILs revolving promissory note. As of December 31, 1995, this facility was completely utilized and an additional $8.6 million, net, had been advanced to the Company and E&J Inc. by BIL. BIL has agreed to extend the due date of such debt to September 30, 1997. In July, 1991, the Company obtained a three year $13 million secured credit line for its Smith & Davis subsidiary which is secured by substantially all of the subsidiarys assets. In February, 1993 this credit line was amended to increase the availability of funding to the Company and reduce the borrowing costs thereunder. The cash proceeds from the sale of the Institutional Business of approximately $4.5 million were used to reduce this debt. The balance due under this credit line was repaid in December 1995 utilizing funds advanced from BIL. The Companys Canadian subsidiary has existing credit facilities in the aggregate of $4.7 million, of which $4.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. During June, 1994 the Companys Mexican subsidiary obtained a credit facility in the aggregate of $1.0 million, on which $0.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Smith & Davis Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. The proceeds consisted of approximately $4.5 million in cash (which was used to repay debt), $2.7 million in assumption of liabilities, and notes valued at approximately $2.1 million; $0.2 million of such notes were repaid in 1995 with the remainder expected to be repaid in 1996. At December 31, 1995 the Company owed $24.7 million to banks and other commercial lenders, $2.1 million under capitalized lease obligations, and $21.1 million to BIL. The Companys 1995 and 1994 revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by ongoing price competition. Long lead times and shipping delays due to start up inefficiencies in the wheelchair manufacturing operations adversely impacted customer confidence. Management continues to address the Companys problems with manufacturing and shipment delays. Additionally, the Company continues to address the rationalization of its production facilities in the US, Canada and Mexico and the increased outsourcing of products and product components, which the Company expects will lower its production costs. Order rates, margins and market share must increase, production and operating costs must be further reduced and customer confidence must continue to be restored if the Company is to generate the cash flow necessary to fund its debt service and operations on a continuing basis and to achieve profitability. Although the Company has programs in place which are designed to address these issues, there is no assurance that such programs will achieve their objectives. With respect to its wheelchair and homecare bed products, the Company anticipates severe price and product competition for the foreseeable future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern concept. The going concern concept anticipates an entity will continue in its present form and, accordingly, uses the historical cost basis to prepare financial statements. The Company has incurred substantial restructuring expenses and recurring operating losses and has a net capital deficiency at December 31, 1995. No assurance can be made that the Company will successfully emerge from or complete its restructuring activities. Management believes that the Companys domestic and international manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet anticipated demand for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 million are projected for 1996 versus actual expenditures of $0.8 million in 1995. The Mexican peso has resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the Companys Mexico subsidiary. No dividends on the Companys Common Stock were paid in either 1995 or 1994. Management does not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The determination of future cash dividends to be declared and paid on the Common Stock, if any, will depend upon the Companys financial condition, earnings and cash flow from operations, the level of its capital expenditures, its future business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on its Common Stock under covenants contained in the debt agreements with its principal lenders. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards The Company and certain subsidiaries file consolidated federal income and combined state tax returns. For federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $143 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1 million that expire in 1997 through 2010. In accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, when certain changes in company ownership occur, utilization of NOL carryforwards is limited. The Company has determined that there has been a change in ownership due to the various debt and equity transactions consummated with BIL as described in Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, approximately $88.5 million of the Companys NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $3 million. If the full amount of that limitation is not used in any year, the amount not used increases the allowable limit in the subsequent year. In addition, there are approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of preacquisition NOL carryforwards generated by Smith & Davis and MCT with expiration dates through 2004. Annual utilization of these NOLs is limited to $0.6 million for Smith & Davis and $0.5 million for MCT to reduce each entitys future contribution to consolidated taxable income.

Financial Condition and Business AnalysisExecutive SummaryThe following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this combined Annual Report on Form 10 K:Earnings Overview and Future Outlook:We earned $1.03 billion, or $3.25 per share, in 2018, compared with $988.0 million, or $3.11 per share, in 2017. Our electric distribution segment earned $455.4 million, or $1.44 per share, in 2018, compared with $497.4 million, or $1.57 per share, in 2017. Our electric transmission segment earned $427.2 million, or $1.34 per share, in 2018, compared with $391.9 million, or $1.23 per share, in 2017. Our natural gas distribution segment earned $93.2 million, or $0.29 per share, in 2018, compared with $74.6 million, or $0.23 per share, in 2017. Our water distribution segment earned $30.9 million, or $0.10 per share, in 2018, compared with a net loss of $1.2 million in 2017.Eversource parent and other companies earned $26.3 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2018, compared with $25.3 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2017.We currently project 2019 earnings of between $3.40 per share and $3.50 per share.Liquidity:Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.78 billion in 2018, compared with $2.00 billion in 2017. Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $2.52 billion in 2018 and $2.35 billion in 2017. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $108.1 million as of December 31, 2018, compared with $38.2 million as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, we issued $2.20 billion of new long term debt, consisting of $1.55 billion at Eversource parent, $500 million at CL&P, $50 million at Yankee Gas, and $100 million at NSTAR Gas. Proceeds from these new issuances were used primarily to repay short term borrowings and repay long term debt at maturity. In 2018, PSNH issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs. In 2018, we repaid, at maturity, $1.05 billion of previously issued long term debt, consisting of $450 million at Eversource parent, $300 million at CL&P, $199.3 million at PSNH and $100 million at Yankee Gas. In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $640.1 million, or $2.02 per common share, compared with $602.1 million, or $1.90 per common share, in 2017. On February 6, 2019, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.535 per share, payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2019. The 2019 dividend represents an increase of 5.9 percent over the dividend paid in December 2018, and is the equivalent to dividends on common shares of approximately $678 million on an annual basis. 27We project to make capital expenditures of $12.75 billion from 2019 through 2023, of which we expect $8.06 billion to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments, $3.35 billion to be in our electric transmission segment and $0.62 billion to be in our water distribution segment. We also project to invest $0.72 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements. These projections do not include any expected investments related to NPT or offshore wind projects. In December 2018, CYAPC paid $145 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre 1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, which is classified as long term debt on Eversources consolidated balance sheet. CYAPC funded this payment from proceeds of its spent nuclear fuel trust, which is classified as marketable securities on Eversources consolidated balance sheet. Eversource consolidates CYAPC because CL&Ps, NSTAR Electrics and PSNHs combined ownership and voting interests in CYAPC is 63 percent. As a result of consolidating CYAPC, CYAPCs payment to the DOE is included in operating cash flows on Eversources 2018 consolidated statement of cash flows. Strategic, Legislative, Regulatory, Policy and Other Items:On February 8, 2019, Eversource and rsted entered into a 50 50 partnership for key offshore wind assets in the Northeast. Eversource paid approximately $225 million for a 50 percent interest in rsteds Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind power projects, as well as the 257 square mile tract off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Revolution Wind is a 700 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, and South Fork Wind is approximately a 130 MW offshore wind power project located 35 miles east of Long Island. Subject to permitting, finalized power purchase agreements, where applicable, further development, and final investment decisions by rsted and Eversource, Revolution Wind is expected to be commissioned in 2023 and South Fork Wind is expected by the end of 2022.On December 12, 2018, PURA approved the Yankee Gas distribution rate case settlement agreement, which included, among other things, rate increases of $1.4 million, $15.8 million and $13.0 million, for rate years beginning November 15, 2018, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively. As a result of this decision, we recognized an $11.7 million pre tax benefit to earnings in 2018 ($4.0 million at the natural gas distribution segment and $7.7 million at Eversource Parent and Other Companies). Earnings OverviewConsolidated: Below is a summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non GAAP financial measure of EPS by business to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of diluted EPS.

The 2017 segment information has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Our electric distribution segment earnings decreased $42.0 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to lower generation earnings of $29.7 million at PSNH resulting from the sales of its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018, higher depreciation expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, higher interest expense, and higher property and other tax expense. The earnings decrease was partially offset by higher non service income from our benefit plans, the impact of the CL&P base distribution rate increase effective May 1, 2018, and the recognition of carrying charges on PSNH storm costs approved for recovery. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense, net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 28Our electric transmission segment earnings increased $35.3 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in the benefits from tax reform as compared to 2017 and approximately $6 million (after tax) in tax related regulatory assets that we concluded were not recoverable from customers.Our natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $18.6 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in sales volumes and demand revenues driven by colder January, April, October and November weather in Connecticut in 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017, as well as growth in new customer base, and an earnings benefit resulting from the Yankee Gas rate case settlement approved by PURA in December 2018. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense, net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The increase in earnings was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. Effective November 15, 2018, fluctuations in Connecticut natural gas sales volumes no longer impact earnings as a result of a decoupled rate structure at Yankee Gas approved in the 2018 rate case settlement. Our 2018 and 2017 water distribution segment results reflect the earnings of the Aquarion water distribution business, which was acquired on December 4, 2017.Eversource Parent and Other Companies: Eversource parent and other companies earned $26.3 million in 2018, compared with $25.3 million in 2017. Earnings were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate due in part to an $18 million aggregate after tax benefit resulting from both federal and Connecticut tax law changes, unrealized gains on our investment in a renewable energy fund, and an income tax benefit associated with our investments. The increase in earnings was offset by a pre tax $32.9 million ($26 million after tax) other than temporary impairment to our equity method investment in the Access Northeast project, higher interest expense, and a lower earnings benefit in 2018, as compared to 2017, related to the allowed recovery of certain previously expensed merger related costs in distribution rates. For further information on the impairment of our Access Northeast project, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures Natural Gas Transmission Project" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Electric, Natural Gas and Water Sales Volumes: Weather, fluctuations in energy supply costs, conservation measures (including utility sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption. Industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes. In our service territories, weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes. Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree days that occur.Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH and natural gas sales volumes at Yankee Gas prior to November 15, 2018 impacted earnings ("Traditional" in the table below). For CL&P, NSTAR Electric (effective February 1, 2018 as a result of a DPU approved rate case decision), Yankee Gas (effective November 15, 2018 as a result of a PURA approved rate case settlement) and NSTAR Gas, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms ("Decoupled" in the table below). These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. Fluctuations in water sales volumes largely do not impact earnings as our Connecticut water distribution business is also decoupled.A 2016 DPU approved energy efficiency plan at NSTAR Electric authorized recovery of LBR in its eastern Massachusetts service territory until LBR was covered under a decoupled rate structure, which occurred on February 1, 2018. NSTAR Electric recognized LBR of $7.0 million in 2018, compared to $73.7 million in 2017, and no longer has an LBR recovery mechanism effective February 1, 2018.A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas MMcf sales volumes, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas Water Sales Volumes (GWh) PercentageIncrease Sales Volumes (MMcf) PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) Sales Volumes (MG) PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) 2018 2017 (1) 2018 2017 (2) 2018 2017 (3) Traditional9,790 9,465 3.4% 44,715 39,45513.3 % 2,252 2,202 2.3 %Decoupled and Special Contracts (4)43,591 42,781 1.9% 61,242 61,571 (0.5)% 21,479 22,565 (4.8)%Total Sales Volumes53,381 52,246 2.2% 105,957 101,026 4.9 % 23,731 24,767 (4.2)%(1) In 2017 and in the month of January 2018, NSTAR Electric operated under two different rate structures (traditional and decoupled) based on its service territory geography. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure. The 2017 sales volumes for NSTAR Electric have been recast to present February through December 2017 as decoupled, to conform to the current year presentation.(2) In 2017 and until November 14, 2018, Yankee Gas operated under a traditional rate structure. Effective November 15, 2018, Yankee Gas operated under a decoupled rate structure. The 2017 sales volumes for Yankee Gas have been recast to present November 15th through December 2017 as decoupled, to conform to the current year presentation.29(3) Eversource acquired its water distribution business on December 4, 2017. Full 2017 sales volumes have been presented for comparative purposes. (4) Special contracts are unique to Yankee Gas natural gas distribution customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers usage.Traditional retail electric sales volumes were higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to warmer summer weather in 2018 and colder weather in January 2018 at NSTAR Electric (prior to its decoupled rate structure). Cooling degree days in 2018 were 25.8 percent higher in New Hampshire, as compared to 2017. Heating degree days in January of 2018 were 21.7 percent higher in the Boston metropolitan area, as compared to January 2017.Our firm natural gas sales volumes are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales volumes. In addition, they have benefited from customer growth in our natural gas distribution segment. Traditional firm natural gas sales volumes were higher in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to colder January, April, October and November weather in 2018. Heating degree days in January through November 2018 were 9.1 percent higher in Connecticut, as compared to the same period in 2017. LiquidityCash and cash equivalents totaled $108.1 million as of December 31, 2018, compared with $38.2 million as of December 31, 2017.Short Term Debt Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements: Eversource parent has a $1.45 billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short term debt. Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas are also parties to a five year $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. Effective December 10, 2018, the revolving credit facilitys termination date was extended for one additional year to December 8, 2023. The revolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parents $1.45 billion commercial paper program.NSTAR Electric has a $650 million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short term debt. NSTAR Electric is also a party to a five year $650 million revolving credit facility. Effective December 10, 2018, the revolving credit facilitys termination date was extended for one additional year to December 8, 2023. The revolving credit facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electrics $650 million commercial paper program.The amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows: Borrowings Outstanding as of December 31, Available Borrowing Capacity as of December 31, Weighted Average Interest Rate as of December 31,(Millions of Dollars)2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Eversource Parent Commercial Paper Program $631.5 $979.3 $818.5 $470.7 2.77% 1.86%NSTAR Electric Commercial Paper Program 278.5 234.0 371.5 416.0 2.50% 1.55%There were no borrowings outstanding on either the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. Eversources water distribution segment has a $100.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires on August 19, 2019, and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and $76.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017.Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time. As a result of the Eversource parent long term debt issuances on January 8, 2018, the net proceeds of which were used to repay short term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, $201.2 million of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were reclassified as Long Term Debt as of December 31, 2017. Intercompany Borrowings: Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short term borrowing needs. In addition, growth in Eversources key business initiatives requires cash infusion to those subsidiaries. Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversources balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to PSNH of $57.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent of $69.5 million to CL&P and $262.9 million to PSNH. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and are classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiarys balance sheets. 30Long Term Debt: The following table summarizes long term debt issuances and repayments: (Millions of Dollars)Issue Date Issuances/(Repayments) Maturity Date Use of Proceeds for Issuances/Repayment InformationCL&P: 4.00% 2018 Series A First Mortgage BondsMarch 2018 $500.0 April 2048 Repaid long term debt that matured in 2018 and repaid short term borrowings5.65% 2008 Series A First Mortgage BondsMay 2008 (300.0) May 2018 Repaid at maturity on May 1, 2018PSNH: 6.00% 2008 Series O First Mortgage BondsMay 2008 (110.0) May 2018 Repaid at maturity on May 1, 20182001 Series A Pollution Control Revenue BondsDecember 2001 (89.3) May 2021 Redeemed on November 28, 2018 at a redemption price of $89.3 millionOther: Eversource Parent 2.50% Series I Senior Notes (1)January 2018 200.0 March 2021 Repaid short term borrowingsEversource Parent 3.30% Series M Senior Notes January 2018 450.0 January 2028 Repaid long term debt that matured in 2018Eversource Parent 3.80% Series N Senior NotesDecember 2018 400.0 December 2023 Repaid short term borrowingsEversource Parent 4.25% Series O Senior NotesDecember 2018 500.0 April 2029 Repaid short term borrowingsEversource Parent 1.60% Series G Senior NotesJanuary 2015 (150.0) January 2018 Repaid at maturity on January 15, 2018Eversource Parent 1.45% Series E Senior NotesMay 2013 (300.0) May 2018 Repaid at maturity on May 1, 2018Yankee Gas 4.13% Series O First Mortgage BondsSeptember 2018 50.0 October 2048 Repaid long term debt that matured in 2018Yankee Gas 6.90% Series J First Mortgage BondsOctober 2008 (100.0) October 2018 Repaid at maturity on October 1, 2018NSTAR Gas 4.09% Series P First Mortgage BondsSeptember 2018 100.0 October 2048 Repaid short term borrowings(1) These notes are part of the same series issued by Eversource parent in March 2016. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of these notes is now $450 million.Rate Reduction Bonds: PSNH Funding LLC 3 (PSNH Funding) is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose, wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary of PSNH. PSNH Funding was formed solely to issue RRBs to finance PSNHs unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets. On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs in multiple tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 3.66 percent, and final maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2035. The RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033. RRB payments consist of principal and interest and will be paid semi annually, beginning on February 1, 2019. The RRBs were issued pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNHs generation assets. Cash Flows: Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.78 billion in 2018, compared with $2.00 billion in 2017. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to cash payments made in 2018 for storm restoration costs of approximately $252 million, an increase of $128 million in income tax payments made in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the unfavorable impacts related to the timing of payments of our working capital items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable. In addition, in December 2018, CYAPC paid $145 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre 1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, as described below. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts were the timing of cash collected for regulatory tracking mechanisms and a decrease of $47.9 million in 2018 of pension and PBOP contributions.CYAPC is obligated to pay the DOE for the costs to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste generated from its nuclear fuel facility prior to April 7, 1983. Eversource consolidates CYAPC because CL&Ps, NSTAR Electrics and PSNHs combined ownership and voting interests in CYAPC is 63 percent. CYAPCs obligation to the DOE is classified as long term debt on Eversources consolidated balance sheet. In December 2018, CYAPC paid $145 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre 1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation. CYAPC funded this payment from proceeds of its spent nuclear fuel trust, which is classified as marketable securities on Eversources consolidated balance sheet. As a result of consolidating CYAPC, Eversource has reflected CYAPCs payment to the DOE within operating cash flows on its 2018 consolidated statement of cash flows. In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $640.1 million, or $2.02 per common share, compared with $602.1 million, or $1.90 per common share, in 2017. Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.505 per share in 2018, as compared to $0.475 per common share in 2017. On February 6, 2019, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.535 per share, payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2019. The 2019 dividend represents an increase of 5.9 percent over the dividend paid in December 2018, and is the equivalent to dividends on common shares of approximately $678 million on an annual basis. In 2018, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH paid $60.0 million, $228.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, in common stock dividends to Eversource parent. Beginning in 2019, Eversource began using treasury stock to fund the payment of shares awarded under the companys incentive plan and dividend reinvestment plan and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.31Investments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP expense. In 2018, investments for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were $2.52 billion, $864.1 million, $725.8 million and $277.3 million, respectively. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each uses its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm related costs, pay dividends, and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions. Eversources regulated companies recover their electric, natural gas and water distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments. The current growth in Eversources construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long term return on investment and recovery period, totaling approximately $2.52 billion in cash capital spend in 2018. In addition, growth in Eversources key business initiatives in 2018 required cash contributions of $205.2 million, which are recognized as long term assets. These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by $1.82 billion, $188.7 million, $430.8 million, and $158.6 million at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, $801.1 million of Eversources long term debt, including $350.0 million, $250.0 million, $150.0 million, $50.0 million and $1.1 million for Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, Yankee Gas and Aquarion, respectively, will mature within the next 12 months. Included in the current portion of long term debt is $36.2 million related to fair value adjustments from our business combinations that will be amortized within the next 12 months and have no cash flow impact. Eversource, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long term debt. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH will reduce their short term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of Eversources credit rating and profile. We expect the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with the access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities.Credit Ratings: On February 12, 2019, S&P changed the outlook on all its credit ratings for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH from stable to negative. A summary of our corporate credit ratings and outlooks by Moodys, S&P and Fitch is as follows: Moodys S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current OutlookEversource ParentBaa1 Stable A+ Negative BBB+ PositiveCL&PA3 Stable A+ Negative A StableNSTAR ElectricA2 Positive A+ Negative A StablePSNHA3 Stable A+ Negative A StableA summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by Moodys, S&P and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of Eversource parent and NSTAR Electric, and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows: Moodys S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current OutlookEversource ParentBaa1 Stable A Negative BBB+ PositiveCL&PA1 Stable AA Negative A+ StableNSTAR ElectricA2 Positive A+ Negative A+ StablePSNHA1 Stable AA Negative A+ StableBusiness Development and Capital ExpendituresOur consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP expense (all of which are non cash factors), totaled $2.86 billion in 2018, $2.52 billion in 2017, and $2.21 billion in 2016. These amounts included $184.6 million in 2018, $165.9 million in 2017, and $137.7 million in 2016 related to information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements, primarily at Eversource Service and The Rocky River Realty Company.32Electric Transmission Business: Our consolidated electric transmission business capital expenditures increased by $91.1 million in 2018, as compared to 2017. A summary of electric transmission capital expenditures by company is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31,(Millions of Dollars)2018 2017 2016CL&P$465.5 $431.5 $338.3NSTAR Electric334.3 301.9 398.7PSNH194.2 155.6 119.0NPT29.4 43.3 40.9Total Electric Transmission Segment$1,023.4 $932.3 $896.9Northern Pass: Northern Pass is Eversources planned 1,090 MW HVDC transmission line that will interconnect from the Qubec New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire.Northern Pass has achieved several key milestones, including receiving the following major permits:National Energy Board of Canada permit issued, which authorizes the construction of the transmission line that will connect with Northern Pass at the Qubec New Hampshire border on March 6, 2018;NHPUC approval on February 12, 2018 for the proposed lease of certain land and easement rights from PSNH to NPT, concluding that the lease is in the public interest;U.S. Forest Service Record of Decision on January 5, 2018, which allows NPT to install approximately 11 miles of underground transmission lines along existing roads through the White Mountain National Forest; Province of Qubec permit granted to HQ on December 21, 2017 to construct the hydroelectric transmission line that will connect at the border of New Hampshire; DOE Record of Decision and Presidential Permit on November 16, 2017, which will allow construction of transmission facilities at the Qubec New Hampshire border; and DOE final Environmental Impact Statement issued on August 10, 2017, which concluded that the proposed Northern Pass route is the preferred alternative, providing substantial benefits with only minimal impacts.The following permits remain outstanding: the NHSEC Certificate of Site and Facility approving construction of the project in New Hampshire, the U.S. Forest Service Special Use Permit, as authorized by the January 5, 2018 Record of Decision, and the Army Corps of Engineers Permit allowing the discharge of dredging material or other fill into wetlands and other waters under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the River and Harbors Act. On January 25, 2018, Northern Pass was selected from the 46 proposal packages submitted as the winning bidder in the Massachusetts clean energy request for proposal ("RFP"), which successfully positioned Northern Pass to provide a firm delivery of hydropower to Massachusetts. On February 1, 2018, the NHSEC voted to deny Northern Pass siting application. On March 28, 2018, the Massachusetts EDCs, in coordination with the DOER and an independent evaluator, notified Northern Pass that the EDCs had terminated its selection and all contract negotiations. On March 30, 2018, the NHSEC released its written decision confirming its denial. On April 27, 2018, NPT filed a motion for rehearing with the NHSEC, and on July 12, 2018, the NHSEC issued its written decision denying Northern Pass motion for rehearing. On August 10, 2018, NPT filed an appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, alleging that the NHSEC failed to follow applicable law in its review of the project. On October 12, 2018, the New Hampshire Supreme Court accepted this appeal. Subsequently, the NHSEC transmitted the record of its proceedings to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on December 11, 2018. Briefing of the appeal began on February 4, 2019. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has not set a date for oral argument. NPT intends to continue to pursue NHSEC approval to construct this project. The March 2018 NHSEC decision denying Northern Pass siting application caused us to review the recoverability of our Northern Pass project costs in the first quarter of 2018. In this recoverability review, we estimated undiscounted expected project cash flows and compared the result to our estimated project costs to determine whether the recorded amount was recoverable. Our undiscounted cash flows were substantially in excess of our estimated project costs. We completed this analysis and concluded that our project costs were recoverable as of March 31, 2018, based on our expectation that the Northern Pass project remains probable of being placed in service. Consistent with Eversources and HQs long term relationship to bring clean energy into New England, Eversource and HQ remain committed to Northern Pass and the many benefits this project will bring to our customers and the region. If, as a result of future events and changes in circumstances, a new recoverability review were to conclude that our project costs are not recoverable, then we would reduce Northern Pass project costs to the estimated fair value, which could result in most of our $307 million of capitalized project costs being impaired. Such an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.Greater Boston Reliability Solution: In February 2015, ISO NE selected the Greater Boston and New Hampshire Solution (the "Solution"), proposed by Eversource and National Grid, to satisfy the requirements identified in the Greater Boston study. The Solution consists of a portfolio of electric transmission upgrades in southern New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts and continuing into the greater Boston metropolitan area, of which 28 upgrades are in Eversources service territory. The NHSEC issued its written order approving the New Hampshire upgrades on October 4, 2016. All the New Hampshire upgrades, including the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, have been completed and placed in 33service. We are currently pursuing the necessary regulatory and siting application approvals in Massachusetts. To date, we have received approval for five of these projects from the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board and anticipate approval of two additional projects in the second quarter of 2019. Construction has also begun on numerous smaller projects, several of which have been placed in service. Most upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. Two projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2020 and another project by mid 2021. We estimate our portion of the investment in the Solution will be approximately $560 million, of which $357.3 million has been spent and capitalized through December 31, 2018. GHCC: The Greater Hartford Central Connecticut ("GHCC") projects, which have been approved by ISO NE, consist of 27 projects with an expected investment of approximately $350 million that are expected to be placed in service through 2019. As of December 31, 2018, 23 projects have been placed in service, and four projects are in active construction. As of December 31, 2018, CL&P had spent and capitalized $232.0 million in costs associated with GHCC. Seacoast Reliability Project: On April 12, 2016, PSNH filed a siting application with the NHSEC for the Seacoast Reliability Project, a 13 mile, 115kV transmission line within several New Hampshire communities, which proposes to use a combination of overhead, underground and underwater line design to help meet the growing demand for electricity in the Seacoast region. On December 10, 2018, the NHSEC indicated its unanimous approval of the project, and subsequently issued its written decision on January 31, 2019. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019. We estimate the investment in this project to be approximately $84 million, of which PSNH had spent and capitalized $31.2 million in costs through December 31, 2018.Distribution Business: A summary of distribution capital expenditures is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31,(Millions of Dollars) CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNH Total Electric Natural Gas Water (1) Total 2018 Basic Business$256.3 $217.7 $69.3 $543.3 $72.9 $17.0 $633.2Aging Infrastructure151.6 133.3 73.0 357.9 280.2 81.1 719.2Load Growth and Other79.7 94.3 15.6 189.6 51.4 3.6 244.6Total Distribution487.6 445.3 157.9 1,090.8 404.5 101.7 1,597.0Solar and Generation 53.4 0.9 54.3 54.3Total$487.6 $498.7 $158.8 $1,145.1 $404.5 101.7 $1,651.3 2017 Basic Business$214.0 $166.1 $67.2 $447.3 $67.7 N/A $515.0Aging Infrastructure180.7 95.4 87.8 363.9 219.9 N/A 583.8Load Growth and Other52.3 96.6 13.2 162.1 47.7 N/A 209.8Total Distribution447.0 358.1 168.2 973.3 335.3 N/A 1,308.6Solar and Generation 100.1 8.5 108.6 N/A 108.6Total$447.0 $458.2 $176.7 $1,081.9 $335.3 N/A $1,417.2 2016 Basic Business$179.8 $146.0 $70.0 $395.8 $70.7 N/A $466.5Aging Infrastructure144.7 105.7 84.7 335.1 155.9 N/A 491.0Load Growth and Other48.6 89.2 17.3 155.1 44.2 N/A 199.3Total Distribution373.1 340.9 172.0 886.0 270.8 N/A 1,156.8Generation 17.5 17.5 N/A 17.5Total$373.1 $340.9 $189.5 $903.5 $270.8 N/A $1,174.3(1) Our water distribution business was acquired on December 4, 2017.

Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above.Offshore Wind Projects: Bay State Wind: Bay State Wind is an offshore wind project being jointly developed by Eversource and Denmark based rsted. Bay State Wind is located in a 300 square mile area of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts and has the ultimate potential to generate at least 2,000 MW of clean, renewable energy. Eversource and rsted each hold a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind. Bay State Wind expects to participate, or has submitted proposals, in the following opportunities for future solicitations for offshore wind based on each states clean energy requirements: The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ("NYSERDA") issued an RFP for 800 MW in November 2018. NYSERDA has the authority to award more than 800 MW in the first solicitation if sufficient attractive offers are received. On February 14, 2019, Bay State Wind submitted proposals, called Sunrise Wind, in response to the RFP. Contracts are expected to be awarded in 2019. Massachusetts second offshore wind RFP for 400 MW to 800 MW is expected to be issued no later than mid 2019. Bay State Wind previously participated in certain other New England RFPs during 2018, but was not selected. Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind: On February 8, 2019, Eversource and rsted entered into a 50 50 partnership for key offshore wind assets in the Northeast. Eversource paid approximately $225 million for a 50 percent interest in rsteds Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind power projects, as well as the 257 square mile tract off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, owned by North East Offshore LLC. rsted acquired all three assets in November 2018 as part of its Deepwater Wind transaction.This transaction builds upon the Eversource and rsted Bay State Wind partnership, which is on a separate 300 square mile ocean tract adjacent to the North East Offshore area. Together, the Bay State Wind and the North East Offshore lease sites jointly owned by Eversource and rsted could eventually host at least 4,000 MW of offshore wind. The two companies will jointly manage permitting requirements for upcoming projects and will honor all planned local investments and agreements entered prior to this partnership.Revolution Wind is a 700 MW offshore wind power project, located approximately 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, that will deliver power to Rhode Island (400 MW) and Connecticut (300 MW). South Fork Wind is approximately a 130 MW offshore wind power project, located 35 miles east of Long Island, that will interconnect into eastern Long Island where it will deliver power to households under a long term power purchase agreement with the Long Island Power Authority. Subject to permitting, finalized power purchase agreements, where applicable, further development, and final investment decisions by rsted and Eversource, Revolution Wind is expected to be commissioned in 2023 and South Fork Wind is expected by the end of 2022.Natural Gas Transmission Project: Access Northeast is a natural gas pipeline and storage project jointly owned by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. ("Enbridge") and National Grid plc ("National Grid"), through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC ("AGT"). Eversource owns a 40 percent interest in the project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. In 2015 and 2016, AGT sought to secure long term natural gas pipeline capacity contracts with EDCs in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island. Subsequently, in 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the NHPUC each ruled that state statutes precluded the state regulatory agencies from approving those contracts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively. The New Hampshire Supreme Court overruled the NHPUC decision in May 2018. Legislative changes are needed in Massachusetts to allow the DPU to approve natural gas pipeline capacity contracts. No such changes have occurred during any legislative session to date.35In September 2018, a series of non Eversource natural gas explosions in eastern Massachusetts resulted in widespread property and system damage, personal injuries, and a fatality. As a result of these events, compounded by the failure to secure Massachusetts legislation to date, we believe there is significant uncertainty around the future timing of, and ability to secure, needed legislative change affecting the natural gas industry and pipeline expansion, which may significantly delay the completion of the Access Northeast project.Eversource identified the September 2018 natural gas series of explosions, compounded by the adverse legislative environment, as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment. Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project, and involved significant management judgment and estimation, including projections of the projects discounted cash flows and assumptions about exit price. In the third quarter of 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable. As a result, Eversource recorded an other than temporary impairment of $32.9 million pre tax within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018, which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investment.FERC Regulatory MattersFERC Transmission Rate Settlement: On December 28, 2015, FERC initiated a proceeding to review the New England transmission owners (NETOs) regional and local transmission rates due to a lack of transparency. The FERC also found that the formula rates generally lacked sufficient details to determine how costs are derived and recovered in rates. This proceeding was set for hearing but held in abeyance to provide time for settlement judge procedures. On August 17, 2018, a signed Settlement Agreement between twenty eight parties, including all six New England state regulatory commissions, the NETOs (including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) and other settling parties, was filed at the FERC. The Settlement Agreement includes, among other things, a new formula rate template, effective on January 1, 2020, in which all regional and local transmission revenue requirements will be determined through a single formula rate. The Settlement Agreement was contested by a group of municipal entities and the FERC Trial Staff. On November 5, 2018, the Settlement Administrative Law Judge reported the contested settlement to the FERC. The NETOs are awaiting an order from the FERC. FERC ROE Complaints: Four separate complaints have been filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively the "Complainants"). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15 month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive ("incentive cap") of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. The ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of 11.14 percent and incentives up to 13.1 percent. On October 16, 2014, the FERC set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at 11.74 percent for the first complaint period. This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014. This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the "Court"). All amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded. Eversource has recorded a reserve of $39.1 million (pre tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of December 31, 2018. This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a 10.57 percent base ROE and 11.74 percent incentive cap. The reserve consisted of $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH as of December 31, 2018. On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE. The parties to these proceedings were directed to submit briefs on this new proposed framework and how they would apply the proposed framework in each of the four complaint proceedings. Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019. The NETOs brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order providing the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results. Reply briefs will be filed on March 8, 2019.The FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERCs proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint. Those preliminary calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs that FERC concludes are of average financial risk, (1) a preliminary range of presumptively just and reasonable base ROEs is 9.60 percent to 10.99 percent; (2) the pre existing base ROE of 11.14 percent is therefore unjust and unreasonable; (3) the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is 10.41 percent; and (4) the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is 13.08 percent. If the results of these illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a 10.41 percent base ROE and a 13.08 percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.36Although the order provided illustrative calculations, FERC stated that these calculations are merely preliminary. The FERCs preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order, as changes to the methodology by FERC are possible as a result of the parties arguments and calculations in the briefing process. Until FERC issues a final decision on each of these four complaints, there is significant uncertainty, and at this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings. The October 16, 2018 FERC order or the January 11, 2019 briefs did not provide a reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the 10.57 percent base ROE and incentive cap at 11.74 percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order. The average impact of a 10 basis point change to the base ROE for each of the 15 month complaint periods would affect Eversources after tax earnings by approximately $3 million. U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes: Effective January 1, 2018, the local transmission service rates were updated to reflect the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On June 28, 2018, FERC granted a one time waiver of tariff provisions related to the federal corporate income tax rate so that, effective June 1, 2018, the regional transmission service rates also reflect the reduced federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. The local and regional transmission service rates do not currently reflect amortization of excess ADIT (EDIT) balances that resulted from the act. On November 15, 2018, FERC issued a Policy Statement and a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking addressing accounting and rate issues related to ADIT changes resulting from the act. After issuance of a final rule by FERC, Eversource expects to file a compliance filing and, after acceptance by FERC, begin the refund of any EDIT through local and regional transmission service rates.Regulatory Developments and Rate MattersElectric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Base Distribution Rates: Each Eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates: CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH and Aquarion operate in New Hampshire and are subject to NHPUC regulation. The regulated companies distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs. In Connecticut, electric and natural gas utilities are required to file a distribution rate case, or for PURA to initiate a rate review, within four years of the last rate case. CL&Ps distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018. Yankee Gas distribution rates were established in a December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective November 15, 2018. See "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Connecticut" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information. Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the PURA. Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 PURA approved rate case. In Massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file at least one distribution rate case every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file at least one distribution rate case every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10 year period. NSTAR Electrics distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU approved rate case with rates effective February 1, 2018. See "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Massachusetts" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information. NSTAR Gas distribution rates were established in a 2015 DPU approved rate case. Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the DPU. Aquarion rates were established in an October 2018 DPU approved rate case. In New Hampshire, PSNH distribution rates were established in a settlement approved by the NHPUC in 2010. Prior to the expiration of that settlement, the NHPUC approved the continuation of those rates, and increased funding via rates, of PSNHs reliability enhancement program. Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 NHPUC approved rate case, further revised in 2016. Electric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Retail Rates: The Eversource electric distribution companies obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. The natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers. These energy supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in energy supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission. The rates are reset periodically and are fully reconciled to their costs. Each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms on a timely basis and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.The electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission approved cost tracking mechanisms and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy efficiency program costs, electric retail transmission charges, restructuring and stranded costs resulting from deregulation, and additionally for our Massachusetts companies, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. The reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates. These cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers.37U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, which amended existing federal tax rules to reduce the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. For our regulated companies, the most significant changes are (1) the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and (2) the reduction in ADIT liabilities (now excess ADIT or EDIT), which are estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion and included in regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2018. The refund of these EDIT regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities. Eversource established a regulatory liability, recorded as a reduction to revenue, to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, until rates billed to customers reflect the lower federal tax rate. As of December 31, 2018, this liability, net of amounts refunded to customers, was $24.6 million. Eversources regulated companies are in the process of, or will, refund the decrease in the income tax rate based on orders issued by applicable state regulatory commissions. A summary of the timing of refunds related to the change in the tax rate is as follows:Eversource Utility and Jurisdiction EDIT Refund Timing Effective Date of New Tax Rate Reflected in Rates January 1, 2018 Change in Tax Rate Prior to Effective Date of New RatesConnecticut CL&P Refunds will be incorporated into May 1, 2019 distribution rate change May 1, 2018 January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018 fully refunded to customers as of December 31, 2018Yankee Gas Refunds began to be reflected in rates effective November 15, 2018 November 15, 2018 January 1, 2018 through November 14, 2018 began to be refunded to customers, beginning November 15, 2018Massachusetts NSTAR Electric Refunds began to be reflected in rates effective January 1, 2019 February 1, 2018 Refunds not required for the period January 1, 2018 to January 31, 2018NSTAR Gas Refunds began to be reflected in rates effective February 1, 2019 July 1, 2018 Refunds not required for the period January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018New Hampshire PSNH Refunds will be addressed as part of the next distribution rate case filingRefunds for EDIT related to PSNHs divested generation assets began to be reflected in rates effective August 1, 2018 No later than July 1, 2019 for distribution January 1, 2018 through effective date of next distribution rate change will be refunded to customersTransmission CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH Refunds will be made based on expected guidance from FERC January 1, 2018 Effective January 1, 2018 for local transmission service, and effective June 1, 2018 for regional transmission service, rates reflected the reduced federal corporate income tax rateFor further information on filings with regulatory commissions and the impact to customer rates, see "Connecticut," "Massachusetts," and "New Hampshire" sections below and "FERC Regulatory Matters U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Connecticut:CL&P Rate Case Settlement: On April 18, 2018, PURA approved the distribution rate case settlement agreement that was reached by CL&P, the Prosecutorial Unit of PURA, and the Office of Consumer Counsel ("OCC") on December 15, 2017, as amended on March 23, 2018. The distribution rate case settlement agreement included, among other things, rate increases of $64.3 million, $31.1 million, and $29.2 million, effective May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively; an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.25 percent; 53 percent common equity in CL&Ps capital structure; and a new capital tracker, effective July 1, 2018, for core capital additions in excess of $270 million per rate year and for capital additions for system resiliency and grid modernization. The new capital tracker also included a provision to return to customers the impact of a lower federal corporate income tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from January through April 2018, offset by the impacts of rate base growth since the previous rate case for the same period. In addition, the base distribution rates charged to customers were adjusted to reflect the prospective impacts of a lower federal income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Amounts related to the EDIT liabilities will be incorporated as refunds to customers in May 1, 2019 base distribution rates. The settlement agreement also incorporated $18.6 million of rate base recovery for catastrophic storms occurring after December 31, 2016, subject to a storm filing. On November 16, 2018, CL&P filed for recovery of $153 million of storm costs incurred from 2017 through 2018, with recovery incorporated into the May 1, 2019 distribution rate change. The storm filing is pending PURA approval.38Yankee Gas Rate Case Settlement: On December 12, 2018, PURA approved the distribution rate case settlement agreement that was reached by Yankee Gas, the prosecutorial division of the PURA, and the OCC on September 21, 2018. The distribution rate case settlement agreement included, among other things, rate increases of $1.4 million, $15.8 million and $13.0 million, for rate years beginning November 15, 2018, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively, and for Yankee Gas to implement a Distribution Integrity Management Program ("DIMP") cost recovery mechanism to further invest capital to replace aging infrastructure. The DIMP mechanism allows for recovery of costs associated with capital additions of approximately $26 million to $37 million annually, which is incremental to the $150 million included in base distribution rate base per year. The settlement agreement also provides Yankee Gas the opportunity to seek recovery of additional capital spending above these levels with PURA approval. PURA ordered an accelerated replacement program for Yankee Gas to fully replace its cast iron and bare steel facilities in 11 years and fully replace copper services and certain steel mains and services in 14 years. In addition, Yankee Gas was authorized to continue its ongoing natural gas system expansion program, implement a revenue decoupling rate mechanism, and recover merger costs. The settlement agreement included a regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent. In addition, the distribution rates charged to customers were adjusted to reflect the prospective impacts of the lower federal corporate income tax rate, the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from January 1, 2018, and the EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although new rates were effective January 1, 2019, the provisions of the settlement agreement took effect November 15, 2018. The settlement agreement resulted in an $11.7 million pre tax benefit to earnings in 2018 ($4.0 million at the natural gas distribution segment primarily for DIMP costs allowed for recovery, and $7.7 million at Eversource Parent and Other Companies for the allowed recovery of previously expensed merger related costs). Clean Energy RFP: On December 28, 2018, under Public Act 17 3, "An Act Concerning Zero Carbon Solicitation and Procurement," the DEEP selected the Millstone nuclear power generation facility, alongside smaller generation facilities, as the winner of the zero carbon electricity generating resource. CL&P was directed by DEEP to enter into a ten year contract with Millstone for approximately 9 million MWh annually. DEEP requested negotiations among all parties conclude by March 31, 2019. Massachusetts:NSTAR Electric Distribution Rate Case Decision: On November 30, 2017, the DPU issued its decision in the NSTAR Electric distribution rate case, which approved an annual distribution rate increase of $37 million, with rates effective February 1, 2018. On January 3, 2018, NSTAR Electric filed a motion to reflect a revenue requirement reduction of $56 million due to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, resulting in an annual net decrease in rates of $19 million. NSTAR Electrics new rates took effect on February 1, 2018, following approval of NSTAR Electrics compliance filing on February 2, 2018. The DPU also approved, in part, NSTAR Electrics request for recalculation, resulting in an increase of $3.5 million in the approved revenue requirement, effective March 1, 2018. In addition to its decision regarding rates, the DPU approved an authorized regulatory ROE of 10 percent, the establishment of a revenue decoupling rate mechanism for the portion of the NSTAR Electric business that did not previously have a decoupling mechanism, and the implementation of an inflation based adjustment mechanism with a five year stay out until January 1, 2023. As part of this inflation based mechanism, NSTAR Electric submitted its first annual Performance Based Rate Adjustment (PBRA) filing on September 19, 2018 and the DPU approved a $31.9 million increase to base distribution rates on December 27, 2018 for effect on January 1, 2019.NSTAR Electric Grid Modernization Plan: On May 10, 2018, the DPU issued an order approving a grid modernization plan for NSTAR Electric. In the order, the DPU pre authorized $133 million in grid facing investments over three years, adopted a regulatory review construct for pre authorization of grid modernization investments, and allowed targeted cost recovery of eligible incremental grid modernization capital and operations and maintenance expenses. The pre authorized $133 million is in addition to $100 million associated with energy storage and electric vehicle infrastructure previously approved by the DPU in the November 30, 2017 order issued in the NSTAR Electric distribution rate case. U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes: The DPU opened an investigation into the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Massachusetts regulated utilities. On June 29, 2018, the DPU issued a decision ordering NSTAR Gas to lower rates effective July 1, 2018 by an annualized $7.3 million. For NSTAR Electric, lower rates due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate were effective February 1, 2018. A second phase of the investigation addressed the EDIT issue and any potential refunds for the periods January 1, 2018 to the effective dates of the rate changes that have occurred. On December 21, 2018, the DPU issued a decision ordering Massachusetts regulated utilities to refund the distribution related EDIT to customers through a new reconciling factor ("Tax Act Credit Factor"). The order also required these companies to include any EDIT that relates to existing reconciling tracking mechanisms to be refunded within those individual mechanisms. The DPU approved compliance filings for NSTAR Electric on December 27, 2018 and for NSTAR Gas on January 18, 2019 for the Tax Act Credit Factor to be included in rates effective January 1, 2019 for NSTAR Electric and effective February 1, 2019 for NSTAR Gas. Additionally, the December 21, 2018 DPU order indicated that the DPU will not require a revision to base rates for any potential refunds for the periods January 1, 2018 to the effective dates of the rate changes. Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, a reserve was not recorded for the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate in customer billings from January 1, 2018 to the dates of the rate changes at NSTAR Electric (February 1, 2018) and NSTAR Gas (July 1, 2018). Eversource and NSTAR Electric Boston Harbor Civil Action: On July 15, 2016, the United States Attorney on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act against NSTAR Electric, Harbor Electric Energy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTAR Electric ("HEEC"), and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (together with NSTAR Electric and HEEC, the "Defendants"). The action alleged that the Defendants failed to comply with certain permitting requirements related to the placement of the HEEC owned electric distribution cable beneath Boston Harbor. The action sought an order to compel HEEC to comply with cable depth requirements in the United States Army Corps of Engineers permit or alternatively to remove the electric distribution cable and cease unauthorized work in U.S. waterways. The action also sought civil penalties and other costs.39The parties reached a settlement pursuant to which HEEC agreed to install a new 115kV distribution cable across Boston Harbor to Deer Island, utilizing a different route, and remove portions of the existing cable. Upon the installation and completion of the new cable and the removal of the portions of the existing cable, all issues surrounding the current permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers are expected to be resolved, and such litigation is expected to be dismissed with prejudice. In 2017, as a result of the settlement, NSTAR Electric expensed $4.9 million (pre tax) of previously incurred capitalized costs associated with engineering work performed on the existing cable that will no longer be used. In addition, NSTAR Electric agreed to provide a rate base credit of $17.5 million to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the new cable. This negotiated credit resulted in the initial $17.5 million of construction costs on the new cable being expensed as incurred, all of which was fully expensed in 2018. Construction of the new cable is underway and is expected to be completed in 2019.New Hampshire:Generation Divestiture: In June 2015, Eversource and PSNH entered into the 2015 Public Service Company of New Hampshire Restructuring and Rate Stabilization Agreement, pursuant to which PSNH agreed to divest its generation assets, subject to NHPUC approval. The NHPUC approved this agreement as well as the final divestiture plan and auction process in 2016. On October 11, 2017, PSNH entered into two Purchase and Sale Agreements with private investors, one to sell its thermal generation assets at a purchase price of $175 million, subject to adjustment, (the Thermal Agreement) and a second to sell its hydroelectric generation assets at a purchase price of $83 million, subject to adjustment (the Hydro Agreement). The NHPUC approved these agreements in late November 2017, at which time the Company classified these assets as held for sale. On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to the Thermal Agreement. In accordance with the Thermal Agreement, the original purchase price of $175 million was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments, closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing, totaling $40.9 million. In the second quarter of 2018, the purchase price was further adjusted by $17.3 million relating to the valuation of certain allowances. As a result of these adjustments, net proceeds from the sale of the thermal assets totaled $116.8 million. On July 16, 2018, FERC issued its order approving the transfer of PSNHs six hydroelectric licenses to private investors. On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to the Hydro Agreement. In accordance with the Hydro Agreement, the original purchase price of $83 million was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments totaling $5.8 million, resulting in net proceeds of $77.2 million. The difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of $17.3 million. An estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on May 8, 2018.On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNHs generation assets. These RRBs are secured by a non bypassable charge recoverable from PSNH customers. PSNH recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the generation asset divestiture and the securitization of remaining costs, which are probable of recovery through collection of the non bypassable charge. For further information on the securitized RRB issuance, see "Liquidity Rate Reduction Bonds" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes: On September 27, 2018, the NHPUC issued a decision on the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The NHPUC concluded that the tax law change qualified as an exogenous event, as defined in the 2015 Public Service Company of New Hampshire Restructuring and Rate Stabilization Agreement, and that the benefit of incurring the lower federal income tax expense would be passed back to customers with carrying charges. The next PSNH distribution rate case shall address the impacts of EDIT, the lower federal income tax rate, and the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from January 1, 2018 to the rate adjustment effective date of July 1, 2019, or earlier if a rate case is filed for rates effective prior to July 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, PSNH has recorded a reserve of $12.6 million to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The EDIT balance related to PSNHs divested generation assets has been included as a component of the securitization of the stranded generation assets and has started to be refunded to customers via the Stranded Cost Recovery Charge effective August 1, 2018.2011 through 2013 Storm Costs: On September 17, 2018, the NHPUC approved the recovery of $49 million, plus carrying charges, in storm costs incurred from August 2011 through March 2013 and the transfer of funding from PSNHs major storm reserve to offset those costs. The costs of these storms (excluding the equity return component of the carrying charges) were deferred as regulatory assets, and the funding reserve collected from customers was accrued as a regulatory liability. The storm cost deferral is separate from the major storm funding reserve that is being collected from customers. As a result of the duration of time between incurring storm costs in August 2011 through March 2013 and final approval from the NHPUC in 2018, PSNH recognized $8.7 million (pre tax) for the equity return component of the carrying charges, which have been collected from customers, within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018. Storm costs incurred from December 2013 through April 2016 have been audited by the NHPUC staff and are pending NHPUC approval. As of December 31, 2018, the pre tax equity return component of the carrying charges related to storms incurred after March 2013 was $7.9 million, which will be recognized to earnings upon NHPUC approval of those storm costs.Reliability Enhancement Program: On December 28, 2018, the NHPUC approved PSNHs extension of the Reliability Enhancement Program for 2019. The extension included cost recovery associated with vegetation management costs. The vegetation management spending, which is consistent with prior years spending, will be deferred and offset against amounts due to customers as a result of federal income tax reform.40Legislative and Policy MattersNew Hampshire: On January 11, 2018, the New Hampshire Supreme Court issued a decision that affirmed the lower courts October 2016 decision that the Town of Bow, New Hampshire had over assessed the value of the property owned by PSNH for the 2012 and 2013 property tax years. As a result of this decision, PSNH received $7.4 million in property tax refunds and interest in 2018.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: Our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses. The regulated companies financial statements reflect the effects of the rate making process. The application of accounting guidance for rate regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.We use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements. We believe it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is made.Pension, SERP and PBOP: We sponsor Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees. For each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost. These assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate and mortality and retirement assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Expected Long Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets: In developing the expected long term rate of return, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants. Our expected long term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our expected long term rate of return assumption used to determine our pension and PBOP expense was 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service plans and 7 percent for the Aquarion plans. For the forecasted 2019 pension and PBOP expense, an expected long term rate of return of 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service plans and 7 percent for the Aquarion plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.Discount Rate: Payment obligations related to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plans cash flows. The discount rate that was utilized in determining the 2018 pension, SERP and PBOP obligations was based on a yield curve approach. This approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. As of December 31, 2018, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of 4.22 percent to 4.45 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 4.38 percent to 4.41 percent for the PBOP Plans. As of December 31, 2017, the discount rates used were within a range of 3.43 percent to 3.75 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 3.55 percent to 3.70 percent for the PBOP Plans. The increase in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in a decrease to the Pension and PBOP Plans liability of approximately $465 million and $88 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. The Company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of Pension, SERP and PBOP expense for the Eversource plans because it provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The discount rates used to estimate the 2018 expense were within a range of 3.85 percent to 4.62 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 3.28 percent to 3.94 percent for the PBOP Plans. Mortality Assumptions: Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record. In 2018, a revised scale for the mortality table was released, and we utilized it in our measurements. 41Compensation/Progression Rate: This assumption reflects the expected long term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that Pension and SERP Plan participants receive in the future. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the compensation/progression rate used to determine the funded status was 3.50 percent for the Eversource Service plans and 4 percent for the Aquarion plans. Health Care Cost: In August 2016, we amended the Eversource PBOP Plan to standardize benefit design and make benefit changes. As a result, this plan is no longer subject to health care cost trends. The Aquarion PBOP Plan is still subject to heath care cost trends. For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate is a range of 3.5 percent to 6.75 percent, with an ultimate rate of 3.5 percent to 5 percent in 2019 and 2023, for post 65 and pre 65 retirees, respectively. Actuarial Determination of Expense: Pension, SERP and PBOP expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent the amortization of differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. Pre tax net periodic benefit expense for the Pension and SERP Plans was $39.6 million, $64.9 million and $71.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the PBOP Plans, there was net periodic PBOP income of $45.0 million, $39.6 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long term rate of return to the Pension and PBOP Plan asset balances. This calculated expected return is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions: We estimate that expense in 2019 for the Pension and SERP Plans will be approximately $72 million and income in 2019 for the PBOP Plans will be approximately $38 million. Pension, SERP and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. Our policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements. We contributed $185.6 million to the Pension Plans in 2018. We currently estimate contributing approximately $112 million to the Pension Plans in 2019. For the PBOP Plans, it is our policy to fund the PBOP Plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts. We contributed $9.3 million to the PBOP Plans in 2018. We currently estimate contributing $11 million to the PBOP Plans in 2019.Sensitivity Analysis: The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plans (excluding the SERP Plans) reported annual cost and a decrease to the PBOP Plans reported annual income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:(Millions of Dollars)Increase in Pension Plan Cost Decrease in PBOP Plan IncomeAssumption ChangeAs of December 31, As of December 31,Eversource2018 2017 2018 2017Lower expected long term rate of return$23.7 $20.4 $4.5 $4.1Lower discount rate25.5 19.7 2.9 3.6Higher compensation rate6.8 9.3 N/A N/AGoodwill: We recorded goodwill on our balance sheet associated with previous mergers and acquisitions. On December 4, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Aquarion, resulting in the addition of $0.9 billion of goodwill. As of December 31, 2018, a total of $4.4 billion of goodwill is recorded on our balance sheet. We have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution. Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. The Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas. The Water Distribution reporting unit was created upon completion of the acquisition of Aquarion and includes the water utility businesses. As of December 31, 2018, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.5 billion to Electric Distribution, $0.6 billion to Electric Transmission, $0.4 billion to Natural Gas Distribution and $0.9 billion to Water Distribution.We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments. We have selected October 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair values of the reporting units assets and liabilities is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment. We performed an impairment test of goodwill as of October 1, 2018 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units. This evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units. Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income. The 2018 goodwill impairment test resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and no reporting unit is at risk of a goodwill impairment. The fair value of the reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value.42Long Lived Assets: Impairment evaluations of long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and strategic, infrastructure and other investments, involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist. Impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate, unfavorable regulatory action, decline in value that is other than temporary in nature, plans to dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery. The review of long lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments, including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flows.Access Northeast: Eversource recorded an other than temporary impairment of $32.9 million within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018, related to Access Northeast, an equity method investment. In September 2018, a series of non Eversource natural gas explosions in eastern Massachusetts resulted in widespread property and system damage, personal injuries, and a fatality. Eversource identified the September 2018 natural gas series of explosions, compounded by the adverse legislative environment, as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment of our investment in Access Northeast. Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project, and involved significant management judgment and estimation, including projections of the projects discounted cash flows and assumptions about exit price. In the third quarter of 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable. For further information, see Note 1K, "Investments," to the financial statements. NPT: In March 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee ("NHSEC") issued a written decision denying Northern Pass siting application after which the Massachusetts EDCs terminated the selection of, and subsequent contract negotiations with, Northern Pass under the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP. The March 2018 NHSEC decision denying Northern Pass siting application caused us to review the recoverability of our Northern Pass project costs in the first quarter of 2018. In this recoverability review, we estimated undiscounted expected project cash flows and compared the result to our estimated project costs to determine whether the recorded amount was recoverable. Our undiscounted cash flows were substantially in excess of our estimated project costs. We completed this analysis and concluded that our project costs were recoverable as of March 31, 2018, based on our expectation that the Northern Pass project remains probable of being placed in service. If as a result of future events and changes in circumstances a new recoverability review were to conclude that our project costs are not recoverable, then we would reduce Northern Pass project costs to the estimated fair value, which could result in most of our $307 million of capitalized project costs being impaired. Such an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2018, we did not identify any other impairment indicators for our long lived assets. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable, we would perform an impairment analysis. An impairment analysis would consist of two steps: first, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset would be compared with the carrying value of the asset, and second, if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge would be recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. This process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non tax deductible expenses, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow through items). The temporary differences and flow through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, which amended existing federal tax rules and included numerous provisions that impacted corporations. In particular, the act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. For our regulated companies, the most significant changes are (1) the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and (2) the reduction in ADIT liabilities (now excess ADIT or EDIT), which are estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion and included in regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2018. The refund of these regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.We have completed our evaluation of the impacts of the act as of December 31, 2018. The ultimate outcome was not materially different from the provisional estimates recorded as of December 31, 2017. While we have recorded the impacts of the act based on interpretation of the provisions as enacted, it is expected the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS will issue additional interpretative guidance in the future that could result in changes to previously finalized provisions. At this time, some of the states in which we do business have issued guidance regarding the act and the impact was not material. Amortization of the EDIT liabilities began in 2018 at our PSNH and Yankee Gas subsidiaries. The total amortization for 2018 was $4.4 million and $0.6 million for PSNH and Yankee Gas, respectively. 43Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. If a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans. A significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability. Estimates are based on the expected remediation plan. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors. Fair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to our Companys derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as "normal purchases or normal sales" (normal), to marketable securities held in trusts, to our investments in our Pension and PBOP Plans, and to nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. This guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long term debt and RRBs.Changes in fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made. We use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model derived valuations. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy related product prices for future years for long dated derivative contracts and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk.

Also, does not include amounts not included on our balance sheets for future funding of Eversources equity method investments, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions.For further information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Note 6, "Asset Retirement Obligations," Note 7, "Short Term Debt," Note 8, "Long Term Debt," Note 9, "Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities," Note 10A, "Employee Benefits Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension," Note 12, "Commitments and Contingencies," and Note 14, "Leases," to the financial statements.45RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIESThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for Eversource for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K: For the Years Ended December 31,(Millions of Dollars)2018 2017 Increase/(Decrease)Operating Revenues$8,448.2 $7,752.0 $696.2Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission3,139.0 2,535.3 603.7Operations and Maintenance1,335.2 1,307.0 28.2Depreciation819.9 773.8 46.1Amortization252.0 90.0 162.0Energy Efficiency Programs472.4 480.8 (8.4)Taxes Other Than Income Taxes729.8 676.8 53.0Total Operating Expenses6,748.3 5,863.7 884.6Operating Income1,699.9 1,888.3 (188.4)Interest Expense498.8 421.8 77.0Other Income, Net128.4 107.9 20.5Income Before Income Tax Expense1,329.5 1,574.4 (244.9)Income Tax Expense289.0 578.9 (289.9)Net Income1,040.5 995.5 45.0Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests7.5 7.5 Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders$1,033.0 $988.0 $45.0Operating RevenuesSales Volumes: A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas sales volumes in MMcf, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas Water Sales Volumes (GWh) PercentageIncrease Sales Volumes (MMcf) PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) Sales Volumes (MG) PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) 2018 2017 (1) 2018 2017 (2) 2018 2017 (3) Traditional9,790 9,465 3.4% 44,715 39,455 13.3 % 2,252 2,202 2.3 %Decoupled and Special Contracts (4)43,591 42,781 1.9% 61,242 61,571 (0.5)% 21,479 22,565 (4.8)%Total Sales Volumes53,381 52,246 2.2% 105,957 101,026 4.9 % 23,731 24,767 (4.2)%(1) In 2017 and in the month of January 2018, NSTAR Electric operated under two different rate structures (traditional and decoupled) based on its service territory geography. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure. The 2017 sales volumes for NSTAR Electric have been recast to present February through December 2017 as decoupled, to conform to the current year presentation.(2) In 2017 and until November 14, 2018, Yankee Gas operated under a traditional rate structure. Effective November 15, 2018, Yankee Gas operated under a decoupled rate structure. The 2017 sales volumes for Yankee Gas have been recast to present November 15th through December 2017 as decoupled, to conform to the current year presentation.(3) Eversource acquired its water distribution business on December 4, 2017. Full 2017 sales volumes have been presented for comparative purposes. (4) Special contracts are unique to Yankee Gas natural gas distribution customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers usage.Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH and natural gas sales volumes at Yankee Gas prior to November 15, 2018 impacted earnings ("Traditional" in the table above). For CL&P, NSTAR Electric (effective February 1, 2018 as a result of a DPU approved rate case decision), Yankee Gas (effective November 15, 2018 as a result of a PURA approved rate case settlement) and NSTAR Gas, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms ("Decoupled" in the table above). These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. Fluctuations in water sales volumes largely do not impact earnings as our Connecticut water distribution business is decoupled.46Operating Revenues: Operating Revenues by segment increased/(decreased) in 2018, as compared to 2017, as follows (the variance in electric distribution revenues reflects intercompany transmission billings in both periods):(Millions of Dollars)Increase/(Decrease)Electric Distribution$405.6Natural Gas Distribution74.9Electric Transmission(15.4)Water Distribution196.1Other5.3Eliminations29.7Total Operating Revenues$696.2Electric Distribution Revenues:Base electric distribution revenues decreased $49.3 million due primarily to lower base distribution rates at NSTAR Electric, as per the DPU approved rate case decision that became effective February 1, 2018. NSTAR Electrics rates were adjusted to reflect the new lower federal corporate income tax rate and the movement of certain costs from base distribution rates to fully reconciled cost tracking mechanisms (most of which did not impact earnings). The decrease in revenues was partially offset by CL&Ps base distribution rate increase as a result of the PURA approved rate case settlement that became effective May 1, 2018 (a portion of which did not impact earnings), and an increase in non decoupled sales volumes primarily driven by colder weather in January 2018 at NSTAR Electric (prior to its decoupled rate structure) and warmer summer weather in 2018 at PSNH. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure.Electric distribution revenues also decreased $28.9 million due to the liability established to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Effective February 1, 2018 for NSTAR Electric and May 1, 2018 for CL&P, rates charged to customers have been adjusted to reflect the new federal corporate income tax rate. PSNH will refund the overcollection in rates from January 1, 2018 to customers in a future period. Tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through regulatory commission approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, have no impact on earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement and other energy related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. In addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers. Tracked retail electric distribution revenues increased as a result of an increase in electric energy supply costs ($219.1 million), an increase in stranded cost recovery revenues ($80.5 million), an increase in retail electric transmission charges ($39.3 million), and an increase in other distribution tracking mechanisms ($84.0 million). Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy related products into the ISO NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties, which increased $48.7 million. Natural Gas Distribution Revenues:Base natural gas distribution revenues increased $17.8 million due primarily to an increase in sales volumes and demand revenues driven by colder January, April, October and November weather in Connecticut in 2018, as well as growth in new customer base. Effective November 15, 2018, fluctuations in Connecticut sales volumes no longer impact earnings as a result of a decoupled rate structure at Yankee Gas approved in the 2018 rate case settlement. Natural gas distribution revenues decreased $8.3 million due to the liability established to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Effective July 1, 2018 for NSTAR Gas and November 15, 2018 for Yankee Gas, rates charged to customers have been adjusted to reflect the new federal corporate income tax rate.Tracked natural gas distribution revenues increased as a result of an increase in natural gas supply costs ($42.8 million), an increase in energy efficiency program revenues ($7.9 million), and an increase in wholesale sales of natural gas to third party marketers ($14.6 million). Water Distribution: Water distribution revenues increased $196.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the acquisition of Aquarion on December 4, 2017.Electric Transmission Revenues: The electric transmission segment revenues decreased by $15.4 million due primarily to lower revenue requirements primarily related to the lower federal corporate income tax rate that was reflected in 2018 transmission revenues, partially offset by an increase related to ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure.47Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity, natural gas and water, on behalf of our customers. These supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)IncreaseElectric Distribution$436.9Natural Gas Distribution48.8Transmission73.6Water Distribution1.6Eliminations42.8Total Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission$603.7The variance in electric distribution reflects intercompany transmission charges in both periods. The increase in purchased power expense at the electric distribution business in 2018, as compared to 2017, was driven primarily by higher prices associated with the procurement of energy supply. As a result of the sale of PSNHs thermal generation assets on January 10, 2018, and the sale of PSNHs hydroelectric assets on August 26, 2018, PSNH purchased power in place of its self generation output in 2018. The increase in natural gas supply costs at our natural gas distribution business was due to higher average prices and sales volumes.The increase in transmission costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO NE that support regional grid investment and an increase in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers. This was partially offset by a decrease in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.Operations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric, natural gas and water distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non tracked costs). Operations and Maintenance expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)Increase/(Decrease)Base Electric Distribution (Non Tracked Costs): Employee related expenses, including labor and benefits$8.5Bad debt expense11.2HEEC Boston Harbor distribution cable costs(12.5)Storm restoration costs(6.3)Other non tracked operations and maintenance13.0Total Base Electric Distribution (Non Tracked Costs)13.9Base Natural Gas Distribution (Non Tracked Costs) Increase due primarily to higher employee related expenses of $4.5 million and higher bad debt expense of $4.3 million9.8Water Distribution Increase of Aquarion operations and maintenance expenses due to acquisition on December 4, 201773.3Tracked Costs (Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution) Decrease due primarily to lower PSNH generation operations expenses of $53.3 million due to the 2018 sales of thermal and hydroelectric generation assets and lower transmission expenses of $18.5 million(83.3)Other and eliminations: Absence of merger related costs allowed for recovery through NSTAR Electric distribution rates as a result of the 2017 DPU distribution rate case decision (absence of 2017 earnings benefit)30.5Merger related costs allowed for recovery through Yankee Gas distribution rates as a result of the 2018 PURA distribution rate case settlement agreement (earnings benefit)(7.7)Eversource Parent and Other Companies other operations and maintenance0.8 Eliminations(9.1)Total Operations and Maintenance$28.2Depreciation expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances and new depreciation rates effective with the CL&P distribution rate case settlement agreement. Partially offsetting these increases was lower depreciation expense at PSNH as a result of the sale of the thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018. Amortization expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy related costs included in certain regulatory commission approved cost tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs. This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. Amortization increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the deferral of energy supply and energy related costs which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and the related rate changes to recover these costs. Energy supply and energy related costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. In addition, the increase includes amortization of PSNHs securitized regulatory asset of $27.3 million related to the 2018 RRB issuance. 48Energy Efficiency Programs expense decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring CL&P to remit 2018 energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut, which totaled $46.8 million in 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in 2017. These costs were collected from CL&Ps customers and remitted to the State of Connecticut; as such we have classified these amounts as Taxes Other than Income Taxes. The costs for the majority of the state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in allowed distribution revenue at PSNH that funded a higher level of expenditures, and higher spending for our natural gas energy efficiency programs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring CL&P to remit 2018 energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut (which totaled $46.8 million in 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in 2017), as well as higher property taxes due to higher utility plant in service balances and higher gross earnings taxes (the costs of which are tracked). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of property taxes as a result of the sale of the PSNH thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018, and a 2018 refund of disputed property taxes for prior years at PSNH. Interest Expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in interest on long term debt ($30.7 million) as a result of new debt issuances, the addition of Aquarion interest expense in 2018 ($23.0 million), interest expense on the 2018 PSNH RRB issuance ($14.4 million), an increase in interest on notes payable ($11.2 million) and an increase in regulatory deferrals, which increased interest expense ($7.1 million) driven primarily by the absence in 2018 of a benefit to interest expense at NSTAR Electric due to the 2017 DPU distribution rate case decision regarding carrying charges for past storms. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in AFUDC related to debt funds ($7.2 million).Other Income, Net increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase related to Pension, SERP and PBOP non service income components ($30.9 million), higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($9.6 million), the recognition of $8.7 million of the equity return component of carrying charges related to storms incurred from August 2011 through March 2013 at PSNH recorded in interest income, and gains on the sale of property ($5.1 million). Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to Eversources equity method investments ($23.6 million), which was driven by a $32.9 million other than temporary impairment to our equity method investment in the Access Northeast project, partially offset by increased unrealized gains on our investment in a renewable energy fund. Other Income, Net was further decreased by investment loss in 2018 compared to investment income in 2017 ($11.5 million) primarily related to unrealized losses on equity marketable securities. Income Tax Expense decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the new federal tax law enacted December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and lower pre tax earnings ($265.2 million), further reduced by state taxes ($3.6 million), which includes a valuation allowance against state tax credits. Income tax expense further decreased by the write off of Access Northeast ($6.9 million), an aggregate benefit relating to both federal tax reform impacts on the tax return compared to the provision estimate and remeasurement of a tax reserve ($18 million), and partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($3.8 million). 49RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANYNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARYPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIESThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K: For the Years Ended December 31, CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNH(Millions of Dollars)2018 2017 Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 Increase/(Decrease)Operating Revenues$3,096.2 $2,887.4 $208.8 $3,112.9 $2,980.6 $132.3 $1,047.6 $981.6 $66.0Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission1,095.2 930.8 164.4 1,257.1 1,025.4 231.7 370.2 237.5 132.7Operations and Maintenance506.4 502.2 4.2 462.1 482.9 (20.8) 210.5 263.1 (52.6)Depreciation278.6 249.4 29.2 276.4 274.0 2.4 92.1 128.2 (36.1)Amortization of Regulatory Assets/ (Liabilities), Net129.0 83.2 45.8 46.7 33.8 12.9 81.0 (16.6) 97.6Energy Efficiency Programs94.0 114.7 (20.7) 292.3 294.1 (1.8) 20.1 13.8 6.3Taxes Other Than Income Taxes357.2 323.8 33.4 194.2 182.0 12.2 77.3 89.7 (12.4)Total Operating Expenses2,460.4 2,204.1 256.3 2,528.8 2,292.2 236.6 851.2 715.7 135.5Operating Income635.8 683.3 (47.5) 584.1 688.4 (104.3) 196.4 265.9 (69.5)Interest Expense151.7 143.0 8.7 105.2 105.7 (0.5) 60.6 51.0 9.6Other Income, Net22.7 23.0 (0.3) 53.1 34.1 19.0 27.7 9.8 17.9Income Before Income Tax Expense506.8 563.3 (56.5) 532.0 616.8 (84.8) 163.5 224.7 (61.2)Income Tax Expense129.1 186.6 (57.5) 148.9 242.1 (93.2) 47.6 88.7 (41.1)Net Income$377.7 $376.7 $1.0 $383.1 $374.7 $8.4 $115.9 $136.0 $(20.1)Operating RevenuesSales Volumes: A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes was as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Increase PercentCL&P 21,467 20,950 517 2.5%NSTAR Electric23,999 23,538 461 2.0%PSNH7,915 7,758 157 2.0%Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings.

NSTAR Electrics distribution revenues decreased $79.3 million due primarily to lower base distribution rates at NSTAR Electric, as per the DPU approved rate case decision that became effective February 1, 2018. NSTAR Electrics rates were adjusted to reflect the new lower federal corporate income tax rate and the movement of certain costs from base distribution rates to fully reconciled cost tracking mechanisms (most of which did not impact earnings). The decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in January 2018 sales volumes, as compared to January 2017, primarily driven by the colder weather. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure, and changes in sales volumes no longer impact earnings.PSNHs base distribution revenues increased $4.6 million primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes in 2018, partially offset by a rate change due to the completion of the full recovery of certain costs in revenues. The rate change did not impact earnings. 50Distribution revenues decreased $16.6 million at CL&P and $12.3 million at PSNH due to the liability established to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Effective February 1, 2018 for NSTAR Electric and May 1, 2018 for CL&P, rates charged to customers have been adjusted to reflect the new federal corporate income tax rate. PSNH will refund the overcollection in rates from January 1, 2018 to customers in a future period. Tracked Revenues: Tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through commission approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings.

Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy related products into the ISO NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties. Tracked revenues increased/(decreased) in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHRetail Tariff Tracked Revenues: Energy supply procurement (1)$172.8 $100.7 $(54.4)Retail transmission(26.7) 75.1 (9.1)Stranded cost recovery3.4 (21.5) 98.6Other distribution tracking mechanisms17.0 58.5 8.5 Wholesale Market Sales Revenue24.4 (4.0) 28.3(1) The decrease at PSNH includes the absence in 2018 of the recovery of generation rate base return due to the sales of its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018.Transmission Revenues: Transmission revenues decreased $6.4 million and $15.3 million at CL&P and NSTAR Electric, respectively, due to lower revenue requirements primarily related to the lower federal corporate income tax rate that was reflected in 2018 transmission revenues, partially offset by an increase related to ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure. Transmission revenues increased $6.3 million at PSNH due to an increase related to ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure, partially offset by the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNHs customers. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in commission approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased/(decreased) in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHPurchased Power Costs$162.9 $141.1 $132.9Transmission Costs(3.7) 75.7 1.6Eliminations5.2 14.9 (1.8)Total Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission$164.4 $231.7 $132.7Purchased Power Costs: Included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers.The increase at CL&P was due primarily to an increase in the price and volume of power procured on behalf of our customers.The increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase in the price of power procured on behalf of our customers.The increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher purchased power energy expenses that are recovered as a component of the Energy Service tracking mechanism. As a result of the sale of its thermal generation assets on January 10, 2018 and its hydroelectric generation assets on August 26, 2018, PSNH purchased power in place of its self generation output in 2018.Transmission Costs: Included in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high voltage lines from generation facilities to substations, including costs allocated by ISO NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The decrease in transmission costs at CL&P was primarily a result of a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers, and a decrease in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network. This was partially offset by an increase in costs billed by ISO NE that support regional grid investment.The increase in transmission costs at NSTAR Electric and PSNH was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO NE that support regional grid investment and an increase in the retail transmission cost deferral. This was partially offset by a decrease in Local Network Service charges.51Operations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non tracked costs).

This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net increased at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy supply and energy related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. In addition, the increase at PSNH includes amortization of its securitized regulatory asset of $27.3 million related to the 2018 RRB issuance. Energy supply and energy related costs, which are the primary drivers of amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes costs for various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs, the majority of which are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense increased/(decreased) in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:The decrease at CL&P was due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring CL&P to remit 2018 energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut (which totaled $46.8 million in 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in 2017). These costs were collected from CL&Ps customers and remitted to the State of Connecticut; as such we have classified this amount as Taxes Other than Income Taxes. The increase at PSNH was primarily due to an increase in allowed distribution revenue that funded a higher level of expenditures. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased/(decreased) in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:The increase at CL&P was due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring CL&P to remit 2018 energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut (which totaled $46.8 million in 2018, as compared to $25.4 million in 2017), as well as higher property taxes due to higher utility plant balances and higher gross earnings taxes (the costs of which are tracked).The increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to higher property taxes due to higher utility plant balances.The decrease at PSNH was due primarily to the absence of property taxes as a result of the sales of its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018, and a 2018 refund of disputed property taxes for prior years from the Town of Bow, New Hampshire, partially offset by higher property taxes due to higher utility distribution plant balances.Interest Expense increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:The increase at CL&P was due primarily to higher interest on long term debt as a result of new debt issuances ($6.7 million) and an increase in regulatory deferrals, which increased interest expense ($3.8 million), partially offset by an increase in AFUDC related to debt funds ($1.2 million).The increase at PSNH was due primarily to interest on the 2018 RRB issuance ($14.4 million), partially offset by lower interest on long term debt ($6.4 million).52Other Income, Net increased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:The increase at NSTAR Electric was due to an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non service income components ($16.8 million) and higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($5.4 million), partially offset by investment loss in 2018 compared to investment income in 2017 ($3.1 million), primarily related to officers life insurance policies.The increase at PSNH was due to the recognition of $8.7 million of the equity return component of the carrying charges related to storms incurred from August 2011 through March 2013 recorded in interest income, a gain on the sale of property ($4.4 million), interest income primarily related to the 2018 refund of disputed property taxes for prior years ($2.6 million), and an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non service income components ($4.0 million).Income Tax Expense decreased in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the following:The decrease at CL&P was due primarily to the new federal tax law enacted December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and lower pre tax earnings ($90.8 million), partially offset by state taxes ($3.4 million), which includes an increase in a valuation allowance of $2.5 million. Income tax expense increased by return to provision items ($10.9 million), federal tax effect of state reserves and credits ($10.6 million) and by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($8.4 million).The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and lower pre tax earnings ($104.2 million), partially offset by return to provision items ($1.2 million), state taxes ($2.8 million), and items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($7.0 million). The decrease at PSNH was due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and lower pre tax earnings ($44.2 million), items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($1.3 million), partially offset by state taxes ($4.4 million).EARNINGS SUMMARYCL&Ps earnings increased $1.0 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to the impact of the CL&P base distribution rate increase effective May 1, 2018, higher non service income from our benefit plans, and an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense, net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, higher property and other tax expense, and higher interest expense. NSTAR Electrics earnings increased $8.4 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, higher non service income from our benefit plans, and lower distribution depreciation expense. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense, net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher property tax expense and higher interest expense. PSNHs earnings decreased $20.1 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to lower generation earnings of $29.7 million as a result of thermal and hydroelectric generation asset sales in 2018, higher operations and maintenance expense, and higher distribution depreciation expense. The earnings decrease was partially offset by an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, the recognition of carrying charges on storm costs approved for recovery, a gain on the sale of property, lower property tax expense due to the 2018 refund of disputed property taxes for prior tax years, and higher sales volumes. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense, net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. LIQUIDITY Cash Flows: CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $588.1 million in 2018, as compared to $806.3 million in 2017. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to cash payments made in 2018 for storm restoration costs of approximately $142 million, an increase in Pension contributions of $38.7 million, and the timing of collections and payments related to our working capital items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts was an increase related to the timing of cash collected for regulatory tracking mechanisms. NSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $780.5 million in 2018, as compared to $639.3 million in 2017. The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the timing of cash collected for regulatory tracking mechanisms, a decrease of $29.0 million in Pension and PBOP contributions, and the timing of payments related to our working capital items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were cash payments made for storm restoration costs of approximately $90 million, and income tax payments of $120.0 million made in 2018, compared to income tax payments of $95.5 million made in 2017. PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $213.3 million in 2018, as compared to $300.9 million in 2017. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the absence of generation operations as a result of the generation asset sales in 2018, and the timing of payments of our working capital items, including accounts payable.

Fluctuations in CL&Ps, NSTAR Electrics (for a portion of its sales volumes as of December 31, 2017) and NSTAR Gas sales volumes do not impact the level of base distribution revenue realized or earnings due to the commission approved revenue decoupling mechanisms ("Decoupled and Natural Gas Special Contracts" in the table above). The revenue decoupling mechanisms permit recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues and breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. Effective February 1, 2018, all of NSTAR Electrics distribution revenues were decoupled as a result of the DPU approved rate case decision. Operating Revenues, which primarily consist of base electric and natural gas distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased by $112.9 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. 54Base electric and natural gas distribution revenues: Base electric distribution segment revenues, excluding LBR, decreased $12.3 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a decrease in sales volumes driven by the mild summer weather in 2017 at our non decoupled electric companies. LBR increased $13.0 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric no longer has an LBR recovery mechanism. Base natural gas distribution revenues increased $2.9 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. The impact of higher firm natural gas sales volumes, which was driven by colder winter weather in the fourth quarter of 2017, was partially offset by lower demand revenues in Connecticut driven by lower peak usage in 2017, as compared to 2016.Tracked distribution revenues: Tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through regulatory commission approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, have no impact on earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement and other energy related costs for our electric and natural gas customers, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. In addition, certain tracked revenues include incentives earned and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers. Tracked natural gas distribution segment revenues increased as a result of an increase in natural gas supply costs ($68.7 million) and an increase in energy efficiency program revenues ($18.1 million). Tracked electric distribution revenues decreased as a result of a decrease in electric energy supply costs ($21.7 million), driven by decreased average retail prices and lower sales volumes, a decrease in retail electric transmission charges ($14.8 million), a decrease in transition and stranded cost recovery revenues ($46.2 million), a decrease in pension rate adjustment mechanisms ($21.6 million), a decrease in revenues related to the timing of the sale of PSNHs RECs ($16.3 million), and a decrease in energy efficiency program revenues ($10.4 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in tracked electric distribution revenues related to federally mandated congestion charges ($30.1 million), net metering revenues ($29.8 million) and revenues related to renewable energy requirements ($41.9 million). Electric transmission revenues: The electric transmission segment revenues increased by $91.7 million due primarily to the recovery of higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure.Other: Other revenues decreased due primarily to the sale of Eversources unregulated telecommunication business on December 31, 2016 ($20.0 million), partially offset by the addition of Aquarion revenues due to the acquisition on December 4, 2017 ($15.9 million). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity and natural gas on behalf of our customers. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)(Decrease)/IncreaseElectric Distribution$(68.9)Natural Gas Distribution59.5Transmission43.9Total Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission$34.5The decrease in purchased power expense at the electric distribution business in 2017, as compared to 2016, was driven primarily by lower prices associated with the procurement of energy supply and lower sales volumes. The increase in purchased power expense at the natural gas distribution business was due to higher average natural gas prices and higher sales volumes. The increase in transmission costs in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO NE that support regional grid investment, and Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network. This was partially offset by a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.55Operations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric and natural gas distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non tracked costs). Operations and Maintenance expense decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)Increase/(Decrease)Base Electric Distribution: Employee related expenses, including labor and benefits$(46.8)Bad debt expense(14.5)Shared corporate costs (including computer software depreciation at Eversource Service)24.2HEEC Boston Harbor distribution cable costs16.0Other non tracked operations and maintenance7.4Total Base Electric Distribution(13.7)Base Natural Gas Distribution4.3Tracked costs (Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution): Absence in 2017 of earnings benefit related to merger related costs allowed for recovery through transmission rates 27.5Other tracked operations and maintenance(4.4)Total Tracked costs (Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution)23.1Other and eliminations: Merger related costs allowed for recovery through NSTAR Electric distribution rates as a result of the November 30, 2017 DPU distribution rate case decision (earnings benefit)(30.5)Addition of Aquarion operations and maintenance expenses due to acquisition on December 4, 20176.9Eversource Parent and Other Companies other operations and maintenance7.6 Eliminations(32.8)Total Operations and Maintenance$(35.1)Depreciation expense increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy related costs included in certain regulatory approved tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs. The deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the deferral of energy supply and energy related costs which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and the related rate changes to recover these costs. Energy supply and energy related costs at the electric and natural gas companies are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change impacting CL&P requiring the remittance of $25.4 million of 2017 energy efficiency funds to the State (resulting in these costs being classified as Taxes Other than Income Taxes), and the deferral adjustment at NSTAR Electric. The deferral adjustment reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the estimated amounts billed to customers. The deferral adjusts costs incurred to match energy efficiency revenue billed to customers and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs. The costs for various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.Taxes Other Than Income Taxes expense increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring $25.4 million of 2017 CL&P energy efficiency costs to be remitted to the State of Connecticut that is included in Taxes Other than Income Taxes, an increase in property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances, partially offset by a decrease in gross earnings taxes. Gross earnings taxes are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Interest Expense increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to an increase in interest on long term debt ($30.3 million) as a result of new debt issuances and an increase in interest on notes payable ($5.1 million), partially offset by a decrease in regulatory deferrals, primarily at NSTAR Electric, which decreased interest expense ($14.7 million) due primarily to the November 30, 2017 NSTAR Electric DPU distribution rate case decision which allowed for a higher rate on carrying charges for past storm costs.Other Income, Net increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased gains on investments ($27.2 million), primarily related to Eversources investment in a renewable energy fund, an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non service income components ($11.3 million), changes in the market value related to deferred compensation plans ($8.3 million) and higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($8.2 million). Partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the absence in 2017 of a gain on the sale of an unregulated business in 2016 ($11.8 million) and lower interest income ($3.3 million).Income Tax Expense increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher pre tax earnings ($29.1 million), lower excess tax benefit ($16.2 million), the absence of tax credits in 2017 ($3.5 million), and the impact from federal tax rate change ($0.5 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($11.4 million), the sale of an unregulated business in 2016 ($10.2 million), and lower state taxes ($3.8 million).56EARNINGS SUMMARYRegulated Companies: Our electric distribution segment earnings increased $34.6 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a lower effective tax rate, lower non tracked operations and maintenance expense, higher lost base revenues at NSTAR Electric and higher distribution revenues at CL&P due in part to a higher rate base for the system resiliency program, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, lower sales volumes primarily driven by the mild summer weather in 2017, as compared to 2016 (primarily at NSTAR Electric), and higher property tax expense. Our electric transmission segment earnings increased $21.1 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure, partially offset by the absence in 2017 of the FERC allowed recovery of certain previously expensed merger related costs in 2016, and a lower benefit in the second quarter of 2017 related to the annual billing and cost reconciliation filing with the FERC. Our natural gas distribution segment earnings decreased $3.1 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher depreciation expense, lower demand revenues in Connecticut driven by lower peak usage in 2017, as compared to 2016, higher non tracked operations and maintenance expense, and higher property tax expense, partially offset by higher sales volumes driven by colder winter weather in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to 2016.Eversource Parent and Other Companies: Eversource parent and other companies, including our water business, earned $25.3 million in 2017, compared with $31.0 million in 2016. The decrease in earnings was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate, higher interest expense and the absence in 2017 of the earnings and gain on the sale of an unregulated business in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by the 2017 DPU allowed recovery of certain previously expensed merger related costs in NSTAR Electrics distribution rates, and increased gains on investments recorded in 2017.LIQUIDITYCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.0 billion in 2017, compared with $2.2 billion in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the $166.3 million net unfavorable impact as a result of the change in income tax payments made, or refunds received, in 2017 when compared to 2016. This unfavorable impact was primarily the result of the December 2015 legislation, which extended the accelerated deduction of depreciation from 2015 to 2019. The legislation resulted in a significant refund of approximately $275 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, there was an increase of $84.1 million in Pension and PBOP Plan cash contributions made in 2017, as compared to 2016, a decrease of $59.8 million related to the absence in 2017 of the Yankee Companies DOE Damages received in 2016, and the unfavorable impact related to the timing of regulatory recoveries, which were significantly impacted by NSTAR Electrics timing of collections of purchased power and transmission costs. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts was the benefit related to the timing of collections and payments of our working capital items, including accounts payable.57RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANYNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARYPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIESThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K: For the Years Ended December 31, CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNH(Millions of Dollars)2017 2016 Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 Increase/(Decrease)Operating Revenues$2,887.4 $2,806.0 $81.4 $2,980.6 $3,041.6 $(61.0) $981.6 $959.5 $22.1Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission930.8 919.7 11.1 1,025.4 1,084.3 (58.9) 237.5 210.8 26.7Operations and Maintenance502.2 490.8 11.4 482.9 500.4 (17.5) 263.1 267.1 (4.0)Depreciation249.4 230.5 18.9 274.0 259.3 14.7 128.2 116.5 11.7Amortization of Regulatory Assets/ (Liabilities), Net83.2 38.8 44.4 33.8 34.3 (0.5) (16.6) 11.2 (27.8)Energy Efficiency Programs114.7 154.0 (39.3) 294.1 321.8 (27.7) 13.8 14.2 (0.4)Taxes Other Than Income Taxes323.8 299.7 24.1 182.0 177.8 4.2 89.7 82.9 6.8Total Operating Expenses2,204.1 2,133.5 70.6 2,292.2 2,377.9 (85.7) 715.7 702.7 13.0Operating Income683.3 672.5 10.8 688.4 663.7 24.7 265.9 256.8 9.1Interest Expense143.0 144.1 (1.1) 105.7 108.4 (2.7) 51.0 50.0 1.0Other Income, Net23.0 14.2 8.8 34.1 21.3 12.8 9.8 7.5 2.3Income Before Income Tax Expense563.3 542.6 20.7 616.8 576.6 40.2 224.7 214.3 10.4Income Tax Expense186.6 208.3 (21.7) 242.1 225.8 16.3 88.7 82.3 6.4Net Income$376.7 $334.3 $42.4 $374.7 $350.8 $23.9 $136.0 $132.0 $4.0Operating RevenuesA summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes was as follows: Rate For the Years Ended December 31, Structure 2017 2016 Decrease PercentCL&P Decoupled 20,950 21,617 (667) (3.1)%NSTAR Electric (eastern Massachusetts)Traditional 20,097 20,619 (522) (2.5)%NSTAR Electric (western Massachusetts)Decoupled 3,441 3,546 (105) (3.0)%PSNHTraditional 7,758 7,860 (102) (1.3)%Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at certain of the electric utilities impact earnings ("Traditional" in the table above). For others, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their regulatory commission approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms ("Decoupled" in the table above). These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. In 2017 and 2016, NSTAR Electric operated under two different rate structures based on its service territory geography. For customers that were served in eastern Massachusetts, including metropolitan Boston, Cape Cod and Marthas Vineyard, NSTAR Electric operated using traditional rates. For customers that were served in western Massachusetts, including the metropolitan Springfield region, NSTAR Electric operated using decoupled rates. Effective February 1, 2018, all of NSTAR Electrics distribution revenues were decoupled as a result of the DPU approved rate decision. See "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Massachusetts NSTAR Electric Distribution Rate Case Decision" in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.CL&P and NSTAR Electric (for its western Massachusetts customer rates) reconcile their annual base distribution rate recovery amounts to their pre established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues of $1.059 billion and $132.4 million, respectively, through December 31, 2017. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric, operating entirely under decoupled rates, will reconcile its annual base distribution rate recovery to its new baseline of $974.8 million. Any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized during a 12 month period is adjusted through rates in the following period.Operating Revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased/(decreased) in 2017, as compared to 2016 as follows: (Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHOperating Revenues$81.4 $(61.0) $22.158Base Distribution Revenues, with changes that impact earnings:NSTAR Electrics base distribution revenues, excluding LBR, decreased $10.8 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, as a result of lower sales volumes driven by the mild summer weather in 2017. LBR increased $13.0 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric no longer has an LBR mechanism. PSNHs base distribution revenues decreased $1.5 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, as a result of lower sales volumes driven by the mild summer weather in 2017. Tracked Revenues: Fluctuations in the overall level of operating revenues are primarily related to tracked revenues. Tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through commission approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement and other energy related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. In addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. Tracked revenues increased/(decreased) in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHEnergy supply procurement$18.8 $(50.8) $10.3All other distribution tracking mechanisms35.0 (33.7) (12.7)Transmission Revenues: Transmission revenues increased by $34.2 million, $31.0 million and $26.5 million at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively, due primarily to higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure.Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNHs customers. For PSNH, these costs also include PSNHs generation of electricity. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in commission approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased/(decreased) in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHPurchased Power Costs$(41.4) $(27.9) $3.7Transmission Costs52.5 (31.0) 23.0Total Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission$11.1 $(58.9) $26.7Purchased Power Costs: Included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with certain energy supply tracking mechanisms and deferred energy supply costs. Energy supply tracking mechanisms recover energy related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers. In order to meet the demand of customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, PSNH procures power through power supply contracts and spot purchases in the competitive New England wholesale power market and or produces power through its own generation. The increase/(decrease) in purchased power costs in 2017, as compared to 2016, was due primarily to the following:The decrease at CL&P was due primarily to a decrease in the price of standard offer supply associated with the GSC.The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to lower prices associated with the procurement of energy supply, lower sales volumes and the expiration of certain purchase power agreements.The increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher purchased power energy expenses that are recovered as a component of the Energy Service rate, and Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative related expenses recovered in the SCRC. Transmission Costs: Included in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The increase/(decrease) in transmission costs in 2017, as compared to 2016, was due primarily to the following:The increase at CL&P was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO NE that support regional grid investment, Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service, and the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.The decrease at NSTAR Electric was primarily the result of a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral. This was partially offset by an increase in costs billed by ISO NE.The increase at PSNH was primarily the result of increases in costs billed by ISO NE, Local Network Service charges, and the retail transmission cost deferral.59Operations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non tracked costs). Operations and Maintenance expense increased/(decreased) in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:(Millions of Dollars)CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNHBase Electric Distribution (Non Tracked Costs): Employee related expenses, including labor and benefits$(4.0) $(36.6) $(6.2)Bad debt expense(6.8) (7.5) (0.2)Shared corporate costs (including computer software depreciation at Eversource Service)7.8 12.6 3.8HEEC Boston Harbor distribution cable costs 16.0 Other non tracked operations and maintenance8.8 0.6 (2.0)Total Base Electric Distribution (Non Tracked Costs)5.8 (14.9) (4.6)Tracked Costs: Employee related expenses, including labor and benefits1.9 (7.5) (1.0)Other tracked operations and maintenance3.7 4.9 1.6Total Tracked Costs5.6 (2.6) 0.6Total Operations and Maintenance$11.4 $(17.5) $(4.0)Depreciation increased at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy related costs and the amortization of storm and other costs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net increased at CL&P and decreased for both NSTAR Electric and PSNH in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy supply and energy related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. The deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. Energy supply and energy related costs, which are the primary drivers of amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes costs for various state policy initiatives and are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:The decrease at CL&P is due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring the remittance of $25.4 million of 2017 energy efficiency funds to the State. These amounts collected from customers were reclassified to Taxes Other than Income Taxes. The decrease at NSTAR Electric is due to the deferral adjustment, which reflects the actual cost of energy efficiency programs compared to the estimated amounts billed to customers and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs. The deferral adjusts costs to match energy efficiency revenue billed to customers. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:The increase at CL&P is due primarily to a State of Connecticut policy change requiring the remittance of $25.4 million of 2017 energy efficiency funds to the State and higher utility plant balances, partially offset by a decrease in gross earnings taxes. Gross earnings taxes are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. The increase at NSTAR Electric is due primarily to higher property taxes resulting from disallowed costs in the November 30, 2017 NSTAR Electric DPU distribution rate case decision and higher employee related payroll taxes, partially offset by a decrease in property tax rates in Boston. The increase at PSNH is due to an increase in property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances. Interest Expense at NSTAR Electric decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower deferred regulatory interest expense ($14.0 million), primarily as a result of the November 30, 2017 NSTAR Electric DPU distribution rate case decision, which allowed for a higher interest rate on carrying charges for past storm costs, partially offset by an increase in interest on long term debt ($9.6 million).Other Income, Net increased in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:The increase at CL&P is due to higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($5.9 million) and market value changes related to the deferred compensation plans ($6.3 million), partially offset by lower interest income ($4.4 million). The increase at NSTAR Electric is due to an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non service income components ($8.7 million), market value changes related to the deferred compensation plans ($1.6 million), an increase in amounts related to officer life insurance policies ($1.3 million) and an increase in interest income ($1.2 million). The increase at PSNH is due to market value changes related to the deferred compensation plans ($1.5 million).60Income Tax Expense increased/(decreased) in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to the following:The decrease at CL&P is due primarily to the tax reform impacts on the federal tax effect of state reserves and credits ($10.7 million), items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow through items) and permanent differences ($10.1 million), the true up of the return to provision impacts ($2.6 million), and lower state taxes ($5.5 million), partially offset by higher pre tax earnings ($7.2 million).The increase at NSTAR Electric is due primarily to higher pre tax earnings ($14.5 million), higher state taxes ($2.4 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of flow through items and permanent differences ($0.6 million). The increase at PSNH is due primarily to higher pre tax earnings ($3.6 million) and the absence of tax credits in 2017 ($3.5 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of flow through items and permanent differences ($0.7 million).EARNINGS SUMMARYCL&Ps earnings increased $42.4 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to a lower effective tax rate, an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, and higher distribution revenues due in part to a higher rate base for the system resiliency program. These favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, and higher property tax expense.NSTAR Electrics earnings increased $23.9 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher distribution revenues related to lost base revenues, net metering and the PAM, lower operations and maintenance expense, lower interest expense as a result of the November 30, 2017 NSTAR Electric distribution rate case decision, and an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base. These favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by lower sales volumes driven by the mild summer weather in 2017, higher depreciation expense, and higher property tax expense. PSNHs earnings increased $4.0 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base and lower operations and maintenance expense. These favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by lower generation earnings, higher depreciation expense, higher property tax expense, lower sales volumes driven by the mild summer weather in 2017, and a higher effective tax rate.LIQUIDITY Cash Flows: CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $806.3 million in 2017, compared with $812.2 million in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to income tax payments of $68.8 million made in 2017, compared to the income tax refunds of $73.9 million received in 2016. Partially offsetting this decrease was the timing of regulatory recoveries, an increase in distribution rates due to higher rate base, and the timing of collections and payments related to our working capital items.NSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $639.3 million in 2017, as compared to $812.1 million in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to a decrease in regulatory recoveries, which were significantly impacted by the timing of collections of purchased power and transmission costs, an increase of $53.4 million in Pension and PBOP Plan cash contributions and an increase of $29.5 million in income tax payments made in 2017, compared to 2016. Also contributing to the decrease was the timing of working capital items, including accounts payable and inventory.PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $300.9 million in 2017, as compared to $360.7 million in 2016. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the income tax payments of $26.1 million made in 2017, compared to the income tax refunds of $36.0 million received in 2016 and the unfavorable impacts related to the timing of regulatory recoveries. Partially offsetting these decreases were the timing of collections and payments of our working capital items, including accounts payable and inventory, and a $16.3 million decrease in Pension Plan cash contributions.61Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket Risk InformationCommodity Price Risk Management: Our regulated companies enter into energy contracts to serve our customers and the economic impacts of those contracts are passed on to our customers. Accordingly, the regulated companies have no exposure to loss of future earnings or fair values due to these market risk sensitive instruments. Eversources Energy Supply Risk Committee, comprised of senior officers, reviews and approves all large scale energy related transactions entered into by its regulated companies.Other Risk Management ActivitiesWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program for identifying the principal risks of the Company. Our ERM program involves the application of a well defined, enterprise wide methodology designed to allow our Risk Committee, comprised of our senior officers and directors of the Company, to identify, categorize, prioritize, and mitigate the principal risks to the Company. The ERM program is integrated with other assurance functions throughout the Company including Compliance, Auditing, and Insurance to ensure appropriate coverage of risks that could impact the Company. In addition to known risks, ERM identifies emerging risks to the Company, through participation in industry groups, discussions with management and in consultation with outside advisers. Our management then analyzes risks to determine materiality, likelihood and impact, and develops mitigation strategies. Management broadly considers our business model, the utility industry, the global economy and the current environment to identify risks. The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for oversight of the Companys ERM program and enterprise wide risks as well as specific risks associated with insurance, credit, financing, investments, pensions and overall system security including cyber security. The findings of the ERM process are periodically discussed with the Finance Committee of our Board of Trustees, as well as with other Board Committees or the full Board of Trustees, as appropriate, including reporting on how these issues are being measured and managed. However, there can be no assurances that the ERM process will identify or manage every risk or event that could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Interest Rate Risk Management: We manage our interest rate risk exposure in accordance with our written policies and procedures by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2018, all of our long term debt except for $39.5 million of fees and interest due for CYAPCs spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, was at a fixed interest rate. Credit Risk Management: Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of our contractual obligations. We serve a wide variety of customers and transact with suppliers that include IPPs, industrial companies, natural gas and electric utilities, oil and gas producers, financial institutions, and other energy marketers. Margin accounts exist within this diverse group, and we realize interest receipts and payments related to balances outstanding in these margin accounts. This wide customer and supplier mix generates a need for a variety of contractual structures, products and terms that, in turn, require us to manage the portfolio of market risk inherent in those transactions in a manner consistent with the parameters established by our risk management process.Our regulated companies are subject to credit risk from certain long term or high volume supply contracts with energy marketing companies. Our regulated companies manage the credit risk with these counterparties in accordance with established credit risk practices and monitor contracting risks, including credit risk. As of December 31, 2018, our regulated companies did not hold collateral (letters of credit) from counterparties related to our standard service contracts. As of December 31, 2018, Eversource had $24.8 million of cash posted with ISO NE related to energy transactions. For further information on cash collateral deposited and posted with counterparties, see Note 1P, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Supplemental Cash Flow Information," to the financial statements.If the respective unsecured debt ratings of Eversource or its subsidiaries were reduced to below investment grade by either Moodys or S&P, certain of Eversources contracts would require additional collateral in the form of cash to be provided to counterparties and independent system operators. Eversource would have been and remains able to provide that collateral. 62
