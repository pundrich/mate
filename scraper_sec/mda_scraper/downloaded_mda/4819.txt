Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7. The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2006 Results Safety Overall, safety results improved during 2006. The employee injury incident rate per 200,000 man hours dropped to its lowest level, which also reduced the number of lost workdays. A continued focus on derailment prevention in 2006 resulted in a 17% reduction in incidents with associated costs declining 13%. In the area of public safety, we closed 410 grade crossings to reduce exposure and have video cameras in approximately 1,900, or 30%, of our road locomotive fleet to better analyze grade crossing incidents, thereby increasing safety for our employees and the public. The number of grade crossing incidents, however, increased 5% during the year, driven in part by the combination of increasing highway and rail traffic and urban expansion. Financial Performance In 2006, we generated record operating income of $2.9 billion. Solid demand, yield increases, and improved operational efficiency drove the 61% increase in operating income. Our operating ratio was 81.5% for the year, a 5 point improvement compared to 2005. Net income of $1.6 billion also topped our previous milestone, translating into $5.91 diluted earnings per share. Commodity Revenue Growth Our commodity revenue grew 15% year over year to $14.9 billion, the highest level in our history. We achieved record revenue levels in all of our six commodity groups, primarily driven by better pricing and fuel surcharges. Since 2004, we repriced approximately two thirds of our business. Volume increased 3% to record levels in 2006, despite softening markets in some sectors in the second half of 2006. Network Improvement In 2006, the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation network improved substantially, which allowed us to handle record volume levels. Continued focus on increasing velocity, eliminating work events, improving asset utilization, and expanding capacity were key drivers of our operational improvement. With ongoing enhancements to our Unified Plan and implementation of terminal processing initiatives, productivity improved, as demonstrated by 5% lower average terminal dwell time, a 4% improvement in car utilization, and a 1% increase in average train speed. We continued implementation of an operational productivity initiative called CIMS (Customer Inventory Management System), which complements the Unified Plan by reducing the number of cars in our terminals without adding capacity. By the end of 2006, CIMS managed the flow of almost 80% of the daily interchange of both loaded and empty railcars with our customers. We also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity, ease capacity constraints, and improve asset utilization. Our customers rated us higher on their satisfaction surveys during 2006, an indication that efforts to improve network operations translated into better customer service. Fuel Prices Fuel prices increased again in 2006 for the fourth consecutive year, raising our average system fuel price by 16% and adding $393 million of operating expenses compared to 2005. After a fairly stable first quarter, fuel prices increased dramatically during the spring and summer months, as crude oil prices averaged over $70 per barrel during the second and third quarters. July and August fuel prices were also affected by high diesel conversion spreads and large, regional spreads mainly driven by new government 17 Table of Contents regulations that imposed certain usage restrictions on high sulfur diesel fuel. Many refineries ceased producing high sulfur diesel fuel and many pipelines stopped transporting high sulfur diesel fuel in our operating areas, which drove up the conversion and regional spreads. Despite some moderation during the fourth quarter, fuel prices were still higher than the beginning of the year. Our fuel surcharge programs helped offset the impact of these higher fuel prices in the form of higher revenue, recovering approximately 90% of the additional expense incurred above our base fuel price of $0.75 per gallon for the year. In addition, our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to handle a 3% increase in gross ton miles while improving our consumption rate by 2%. Simulator training, operating practices, and technology are all driving this improvement, saving us roughly 17 million gallons in 2006. Free Cash Flow Cash generated by operating activities totaled a record $2.9 billion, yielding free cash flow of $516 million in 2006. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S K. We believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non GAAP measure): Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,880 $ 2,595 $ 2,257 Cash used in investing activities (2,042 ) (2,047 ) (1,732 ) Dividends paid (322 ) (314 ) (310 ) Free cash flow $ 516 $ 234 $ 215 2007 Outlook Safety Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders, and the public. We will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety, using technology, risk assessment, quality control, and training and education for our new and existing employees. From a public safety standpoint, we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings, install video cameras on locomotives, and educate the public about crossing safety through various internal and industry programs, along with other activities. Additionally, we are working with private and public partners to develop better tank cars for transportation of chemicals. Commodity Revenue Growth We expect record revenue levels to continue in 2007 based on current economic indicators, forecasted demand, and additional repricing opportunities. We established a target for year over year commodity revenue growth of 6% to 7%. We are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups and volume growth ranging from 2% to 3%. We expect volume growth primarily from the energy and intermodal commodity groups. We will continue to monitor the market for changing conditions and adjust our plan accordingly. Transportation Plan In 2007, we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency. We plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives, improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques, and improve our operating margins. Fuel Prices We expect that fuel prices will remain volatile, with crude oil prices and conversion and regional spreads fluctuating throughout the year. To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts. As indicated in Item 1 of this report, the STB issued a decision limiting the manner in 18 Table of Contents which U.S. railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the STB. Currently, we do not believe this decision will prevent us from using fuel surcharges or adversely affect our ability to use fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of rising or elevated fuel prices on most or all of our traffic. Capital Plan In 2007, we expect to make capital investments of approximately $3.2 billion, which may include long term leases. These investments will be used to maintain track and structures; continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors; remove bottlenecks; upgrade and augment equipment, including locomotives and railcars, to better meet customer needs; build and improve facilities and terminals; and develop and implement new technologies. We designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety, enhance customer service, promote growth, and improve operational fluidity. Major capital projects in 2007 include adding more double track on the Sunset Corridor and related line capacity; investing in new and existing facilities and terminals in Phoenix, Tucson, the LA Basin, San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Houston; continuing improvements of the SPRB Joint Line; and continuing installation of centralized track control across Iowa and Nebraska, which enables us to increase productivity on these rail lines. We expect to fund our 2007 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2006. This focused capital plan is designed to help us improve network velocity and facilitate revenue growth. Financial Expectations We are somewhat cautious about the economic environment; however, we anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in 2007, with financial results exceeding 2006 levels. Our expectations include generating earnings growth of 10% to 15% and an operating ratio below 80%. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenue Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Commodity revenue $ 14,862 $ 12,957 $ 11,692 15 % 11 % Other revenue 716 621 523 15 19 Total $ 15,578 $ 13,578 $ 12,215 15 % 11 % Operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries, revenue from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us. We recognize commodity revenue on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. We allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them. We recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipments. All six commodity groups experienced double digit revenue growth during 2006, with particularly strong growth of over 20% in agricultural commodity revenue. Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators, which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices, all contributed to higher average revenue per car (ARC). Our fuel surcharge programs (excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel) generated an additional $656 million in commodity revenue compared to 2005, contributing 5% to commodity revenue growth. Volume increased 3% during the year led by solid growth in intermodal and energy shipments, which was partially offset by lower shipments of industrial products and chemicals. The year over year growth was also partially attributable to lower volume in 2005 due to the January West Coast storm, SPRB Joint Line disruptions, Hurricane Rita, and the Kansas washouts. 19 Table of Contents Commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during 2005, with double digit growth in the agricultural, industrial products, and intermodal commodity groups. Fuel surcharges, price increases, and index based contract escalators all contributed to higher ARC. Our fuel surcharge programs (excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel) generated an additional $671 million in commodity revenue compared to 2004, which represents approximately 70% of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs (currently, $0.75 per gallon). Although volume grew 1% for the year, the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the SPRB Joint Line constrained volume growth. Other revenue increased in 2006, mainly driven by higher volumes. In addition, we generated higher subsidiary revenue from Bay Pacific Financial L.L.C. (Bay Pacific), an intermodal leasing entity, following the acquisition of our joint venture partners interest in Bay Pacific during the third quarter of 2005. Subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in 2005, mainly driven by higher volumes and the acquisition of Bay Pacific. The following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue, revenue carloads, and average revenue per car by commodity group. Commodity Revenue Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Agricultural $ 2,395 $ 1,971 $ 1,675 22 % 18 % Automotive 1,438 1,273 1,235 13 3 Chemicals 2,098 1,848 1,719 13 8 Energy 2,953 2,578 2,404 15 7 Industrial Products 3,173 2,819 2,419 13 17 Intermodal 2,805 2,468 2,240 14 10 Total $ 14,862 $ 12,957 $ 11,692 15 % 11 % Revenue Carloads Thousands 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Agricultural 923 883 883 5 % % Automotive 834 797 826 5 (4 ) Chemicals 896 912 935 (2 ) (2 ) Energy 2,296 2,178 2,172 5 Industrial Products 1,451 1,508 1,515 (4 ) Intermodal 3,452 3,266 3,127 6 4 Total 9,852 9,544 9,458 3 % 1 % Average Revenue per Car 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Agricultural $ 2,595 $ 2,233 $ 1,895 16 % 18 % Automotive 1,724 1,598 1,496 8 7 Chemicals 2,342 2,026 1,839 16 10 Energy 1,286 1,184 1,107 9 7 Industrial Products 2,187 1,868 1,597 17 17 Intermodal 813 755 716 8 5 Total $ 1,509 $ 1,358 $ 1,236 11 % 10 % 20 Table of Contents Agricultural Price increases, volume growth, and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in 2006 versus 2005. Whole grains increased as strong gulf exports and higher freight charges for barge traffic shifted feed grain shipments to rails. Shipments of ethanol, a grain product used as an alternative fuel and fuel additive, and its co products (primarily livestock feed) also experienced strong growth, reflecting continued demand in this growing industry. Conversely, wheat shipments declined due to extremely low crop production levels in 2006 primarily due to drought conditions in wheat producing states. Price and fuel surcharge increases improved ARC in 2006. Price increases and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in 2005 compared to 2004. Total carloads were flat compared to 2004. Carloads of grain products increased during 2005 as we shipped more dry feed ingredients to Mexico and more ethanol. Higher demand for ethanol reflected the impact of energy demand, crude oil prices, and limited capacity of domestic refineries. Reduced carloadings of sugar beets partially offset the gains. Declining carloads of feed grain and reduced shipments of wheat both contributed to lower whole grain shipments. ARC improvement in 2005 resulted from price increases, fuel surcharges, and the positive impact of a larger percentage of carloads with longer average lengths of haul. Automotive Price increases, volume growth, and fuel surcharges increased automotive commodity revenue in 2006 over 2005. Shipments of finished vehicles grew as higher manufacturer inventories at the end of 2005 translated into record volume growth for transportation in 2006. Shipments remained relatively strong through the second quarter due to the production ramp up of new models at plants served by us. Automotive parts shipments also grew due to conversion of traffic from trucks, new business growth, and production increases at several UPRR served assembly plants. Fuel surcharges and price increases drove the ARC improvement. Revenue increased in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to fuel surcharges and price increases, which also drove ARC improvement. Carloads decreased due to lower shipments of domestically manufactured finished vehicles and automotive parts and materials, reflecting industry weakness during 2005. 21 Table of Contents Chemicals Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators drove the increase in revenue and ARC in 2006 versus 2005. Fewer fertilizer shipments largely drove the volume decrease. Wet weather conditions in the Midwest led to weak demand during the fall fertilizer season. In addition, softer export markets for potash, a fertilizer product, also led to reduced volumes. Business interruptions in the third quarter of 2005, primarily attributable to Hurricane Rita, reduced chemicals shipments leading to favorable volume comparisons in 2006. Price increases, fuel surcharges, and higher shipments of potash from Canada to Portland via the Eastport, Idaho gateway for overseas export all drove revenue growth in 2005 versus 2004. Declines in liquid and dry chemicals, plastics, and petroleum shipments, in part due to the business interruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, reduced volume. In addition, liquid and dry chemical shipments and plastic shipments were lower due to a weak export market, plant closures for maintenance, and the impact of an agreement with the BNSF for access to certain facilities in the Bayport, Texas area. ARC improved in 2005 due to price increases and fuel surcharges. Energy Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators primarily drove the increases in revenue and ARC in 2006 over 2005. Volume increases also contributed to revenue growth as coal shipments from the SPRB mines improved 8% during the year. These increases in 2006 partially reflect lower volume levels in 2005, as SPRB Joint Line disruptions, network disruptions resulting from Hurricane Rita, and the October Kansas washouts hampered coal shipments in 2005. Conversely, shipments from the Colorado and Utah mines declined 6% in 2006 due to mine shutdowns during the first quarter of 2006, along with the impact of mining production problems and network maintenance throughout the third quarter of 2006. Revenue growth in 2005 over 2004 reflects higher prices, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators. Although volume grew in the first quarter, carloads for 2005 were flat as a result of the extensive maintenance and restoration work on the SPRB Joint Line during the second, third, and fourth quarters, the impact of Hurricane Rita, the Kansas washouts, and temporary outages at mines in Colorado and Utah during the fourth quarter of 2005. ARC was higher due to price increases, higher fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators. 22 Table of Contents Industrial Products Price increases and fuel surcharges improved revenue and ARC in 2006 over 2005. Volume levels declined due to lower lumber, paper, and newsprint shipments, which were partially offset by higher steel shipments. The softening of the housing market, lower production levels, and general market uncertainty drove the reduction in lumber shipments. Conversely, strong domestic markets throughout most of the year drove the increase in construction related steel material and pipe, particularly those materials used in oil and gas drilling. Hurricane Rita reduced shipment volumes of industrial products in 2005, which favorably affected volume comparisons with 2006. Price increases and fuel surcharges generated revenue growth in 2005 versus 2004. In particular, lumber shipments contributed to this growth due to solid pricing gains and fuel surcharges. Revenue from stone shipments increased revenue from construction products due to strong construction demand, larger train sizes, and improved car cycle times. Car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system measured from the origin of the loaded or empty move until arrival at final destination. Overall carloads were flat compared to 2004. Partially offsetting substantial volume growth of stone shipments were reduced paper moves, primarily newsprint and fiber, and fewer shipments of government materials, steel, and cement, resulting from softening markets, cement shortages in certain markets, and higher inventories. Price increases and fuel surcharges drove ARC increases. Intermodal Record volume growth, fuel surcharges, price increases, and index based contract escalators combined to improve revenue in 2006 over 2005 in addition to the favorable impact from weaker intermodal revenue during 2005 due to the January West Coast storm. Carloadings grew due to strong imports, primarily from Asia, partially offset by decreased domestic traffic. ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and contract escalators. Revenue in 2005 improved over 2004 due to strong imports, primarily from China and the rest of Asia. However, business interruptions during the first quarter of 2005 due to the January West Coast storm limited full year revenue growth. ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and contract escalators. Mexico Business Each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business increased 23% to $1.4 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, fuel surcharges, and shipments of finished vehicles, automotive parts, import beer, dry feed ingredients, and 23 Table of Contents intermodal drove revenue growth in 2006. Volume declines in coal, newsprint, and sulfur shipments partially offset the increases. In 2005, revenue from Mexico grew 15% to $1.1 billion, resulting primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges. Carloads were flat versus 2004, as fewer automotive parts, energy, and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments. Operating Expenses Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Salaries, wages, and employee benefits $ 4,599 $ 4,375 $ 4,167 5 % 5 % Fuel and utilities 3,012 2,562 1,816 18 41 Equipment and other rents 1,455 1,402 1,374 4 2 Depreciation 1,237 1,175 1,111 5 6 Materials and supplies 691 546 488 27 12 Casualty costs 410 411 694 (41 ) Purchased services and other costs 1,290 1,312 1,270 (2 ) 3 Total $ 12,694 $ 11,783 $ 10,920 8 % 8 % Operating expenses increased $911 million in 2006. Higher fuel prices, which rose 16% during the period, accounted for $393 million of the increase. Our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue, recovering approximately 90% of the additional expense incurred above our base fuel price of $0.75 per gallon for the year. We base a majority of our fuel surcharges on the average U.S. diesel fuel price effective two months prior. Our recovery percentage improved from the first part of 2006 due to the timing impact of our surcharges. Surcharge revenue began to recover higher fuel costs earlier in the year, and the two month price lag caught up with declining fuel prices during the fourth quarter of 2006. Conversely, fuel surcharge revenue during the first quarter of 2007 will decline as lower fourth quarter fuel prices will reduce most of our surcharges. Wages, benefits, and materials and supplies inflation; a larger workforce; volume related expenses; and higher locomotive and freight car maintenance and lease expenses accounted for most of the additional increase in 2006. Settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the 2005 January West Coast storm, an improved fuel consumption rate, and improved car cycle times (which reduced freight car rental expense) partially offset the cost increases. Additional clean up and restoration costs for the 2005 January West Coast storm favorably affects comparison of 2005 operating expenses with those in 2006. 24 Table of Contents Operating expenses increased $863 million in 2005 versus 2004. Excluding the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre tax) in 2004, operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 10%. Significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for $740 million of this increase (our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue). Inflation in wages, benefits, materials, and services, as well as a larger workforce, resulted in most of the additional increase. Also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and clean up and restoration costs associated with the 2005 January West Coast storm. Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits General wage and benefit inflation increased expenses in 2006, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare costs and other benefit costs. A larger workforce, driven by higher volume levels, and stock option expense required by new accounting rules also contributed to higher expenses. Conversely, reduced protection costs and operational improvements, boosted by network management initiatives and investment in capacity, partially offset these increases. Protection costs represent the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employees protected rate of pay. An individuals protected rate is imposed by the STB for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions in certain cases. Additionally, we incurred higher labor expenses in 2005 for clean up and restoration of property damaged by the January West Coast storm. Several factors drove higher employment expenses in 2005. General wage and benefit inflation increased expenses, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the year over year impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs. We also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in 2005, as executive bonuses were not awarded for 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced in 2004. A 3% increase in our workforce and higher demand during 2005 also contributed to the increases. Additionally, labor expenses, in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and clean up activities, increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the West Coast storm in the first quarter. Reduced severance and relocation costs, increased network efficiency, and reduced training expenses partially offset these increases. Transferring various support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska, resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in 2004. Fuel and Utilities Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Locomotive fuel expense $ 2,821 $ 2,393 $ 1,684 18 % 42 % Fuel surcharge revenue 1,619 963 292 68 230 Fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and other fuels. Higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.06 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2006 compared to $1.77 per gallon in 2005, increased expenses by $393 million. A 3% increase in gross ton miles resulted in $63 million of additional expenses, which was partially offset by a 2% improvement in our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer, more fuel efficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs. As noted above (and described in this Item 7), we offset a significant portion of increased locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges. Gasoline, utilities, and propane and other fuel expenses increased $20 million in 2006 due to higher prices and increased usage. In 2005, diesel fuel prices averaged $1.77 per gallon compared to $1.22 per gallon in 2004, increasing expenses by $740 million. A 1% increase in gross ton miles resulted in $8 million of additional expenses. We offset $39 million of these increases with a 2% improvement in our consumption rate in 2005 versus 2004. The Railroad had no fuel hedges in place during 2005, whereas we hedged 120 million gallons of fuel in 2004. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $37 million in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher prices. Equipment and Other Rents Equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; other 25 Table of Contents specialty equipment leases; and office and other rentals. Lease expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 as we leased more locomotives and freight cars. Growth in automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our short term freight car rental expense. Improved car cycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase. In 2005, the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased, resulting in higher lease expense. Carload volume growth also increased 2005 expenses. Improved car cycle times partially offset these increases which lowered our short term freight car rental expense. Depreciation The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties, and other track material. A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, and increased usage of our assets combined for higher depreciation expense in 2006 and 2005. Materials and Supplies Materials used to maintain the Railroads lines, structures, and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense. This expense item also includes small tools, office supplies, other materials, and the costs of freight services to ship Railroad supplies and materials. We used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and our fleet of locomotives in 2006, including a growing number of units not covered by warranties. In addition, we performed more maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with third party contractors compared to 2005. During 2005, materials and supplies expense increased, primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance. We used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives, including a growing number of units not covered by warranties. Additionally, we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets, traction motors, and lube oil. Conversely, we incurred lower freight charges for shipping Railroad materials, and stationery and office supplies. Casualty Costs Personal injury costs, freight and property damage, insurance, and environmental expense are the primary components of casualty costs. Costs were flat in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower bad debt expenses, lower freight damage expenses, and lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset personal injury costs and higher settlement expenses. In 2005, casualty costs were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in 2004 for an asbestos charge, a costly derailment near San Antonio, and a large jury verdict affirmed in 2004 for a 1998 crossing accident. Lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs. Conversely, we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for third party personal injuries and damages related to environmental exposures. Purchased Services and Other Costs Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular expense, employee travel expense, and computer and other general expenses. Volume related expenses, including crew transportation and lodging costs, increased in 2006 driven by 3% growth of carloads. Higher state and local taxes (primarily sales and use taxes related to higher diesel fuel prices) also increased expenses in 2006 compared to 2005. Conversely, lower locomotive contract maintenance costs and lower expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities reduced expenses in 2006 compared to 2005. Settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the 2005 January West Coast storm and the gain from the sale of two airplanes also reduced expenses in 2006. Finally, clean up and restoration costs related to the January West Coast storm increased expenses in 2005, which also contributed to lower year over year expenses in 2006. Expenses increased in 2005 versus 2004 because we experienced higher volume related costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging. Although our intermodal carloadings 26 Table of Contents increased over 4% in 2005, costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies. Higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in 2005, which resulted in higher state and local taxes. Other contract expenses for equipment maintenance and other services increased in 2005. The 2005 January West Coast storm and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 (net of insurance settlements received). Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in relocation expenses as we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska during 2004. Non Operating Items Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Other income $ 118 $ 145 $ 88 (19 )% 65 % Interest expense (477 ) (504 ) (527 ) (5 ) (4 ) Income taxes (919 ) (410 ) (252 ) 124 63 Other Income Lower net gains from non operating asset sales and higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in 2006, which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our right of way (including 2006 settlements of rate disputes from prior years) and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates. In 2005, other income increased largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program. Interest Expense Lower interest expense in 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to declining weighted average debt levels of $7.1 billion, $7.8 billion, and $8.1 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. A higher effective interest rate of 6.7% in 2006, compared to 6.5% in both 2005 and 2004, partially offset the effects of the declining debt level. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $509 million higher in 2006 than 2005. Higher pre tax income resulted in additional taxes of $414 million and $118 million of the increase resulted from the one time reduction in 2005 described below. Our effective tax rate was 36.4% and 28.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income taxes were greater in 2005 than 2004 due to higher pre tax income partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense. In our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, we reported that the Corporation analyzed the impact that final settlements of pre 1995 tax years had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The completed analysis of the final settlements for pre 1995 tax years, along with Internal Revenue Service Examination Reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered, among other things, in a review and re evaluation of the Corporations estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2005, resulting in an income tax expense reduction of $118 million in 2005. 27 Table of Contents OPERATING AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS Railroad Performance Measures We report key Railroad performance measures weekly to the Association of American Railroads, including carloads, average daily inventory of rail cars on our system, average train speed, and average terminal dwell time. This operating data is available on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml. Operating Statistics 2006 2005 2004 % Change2006 v 2005 % Change2005 v 2004 Average train speed (miles per hour) 21.4 21.1 21.4 1 % (1 )% Average terminal dwell time (hours) 27.2 28.7 30.5 (5 ) (6 ) Gross ton miles (billions) 1,072.5 1,043.9 1,037.5 3 1 Revenue ton miles (billions) 565.2 548.8 546.3 3 Average full time equivalent employees 50,739 49,747 48,329 2 3 Average Train Speed Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals. Ongoing network management initiatives and capacity expansion allowed us to move 3% more carloads in 2006 and improve average train speed 1%. In 2005, the January West Coast storm, disruptions on the SPRB Joint Line, business interruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, and the Kansas washouts in October hampered efforts to improve our average train speed. Average Terminal Dwell Time Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time is favorable. Average terminal dwell improved 5% and 6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of ongoing management initiatives and directed efforts to more timely deliver rail cars offline to our interchange partners and customers. Gross and Revenue Ton Miles Gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. In 2006, gross and revenue ton miles grew 3% in relation to the 3% increase in carloadings as volume was balanced between the higher and lower density commodities. In 2005, gross ton miles grew 1%, in relation to a 1% increase of carloadings. Revenue ton miles were flat in 2005. Average Full Time Equivalent Employees Higher employee levels in 2006 and 2005 included more people to maintain our larger locomotive and freight car fleet, the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs, the hiring of operations management personnel, including an expanded management training program, and train and engine personnel to manage current demand. 28 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital Millions of Dollars, Except Percentages 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 1,606 $ 1,026 $ 604 Add: Interest expense 477 504 527 Add: Sale of receivables fees 33 23 11 Add: Interest on present value of operating leases 268 218 172 Less: Taxes on interest and fees (283 ) (213 ) (209 ) Net operating profit after taxes as adjusted (a) $ 2,101 $ 1,558 $ 1,105 Average equity $ 14,510 $ 13,181 $ 12,505 Add: Average debt 7,098 7,774 8,060 Add: Average value of sold receivables 600 595 590 Add: Average present value of operating leases 3,349 2,729 2,147 Average invested capital as adjusted (b) $ 25,557 $ 24,279 $ 23,302 Return on invested capital as adjusted (a/b) 8.2 % 6.4 % 4.7 % Return on invested capital (ROIC) is considered a non GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S K. We believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the Corporations long term capital investments, and we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation for our executive officers and senior management. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. A comparable GAAP measure is Return on Equity, which is included in Selected Financial Data, Item 6.

We believe this measure is important in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including off balance sheet lease obligations. We monitor the ratio of lease adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost effective and efficient access to the capital markets with the Corporations overall cost of capital. Lease adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The table above provides support for the lease adjusted debt to capital calculation. Our debt to capital ratios improved as a result of a $636 million reduction in debt from December 31, 2005, and an increase in retained earnings due to higher net income in 2006. 29 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables, and our revolving credit facilities, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $2 billion of committed credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2006, and we did not make any short term borrowings under these facilities during the year. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was $600 million as of December 31, 2006. The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements, including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $1.1 billion. A working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. Financial Condition Cash Flows Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,880 $ 2,595 $ 2,257 Cash used in investing activities (2,042 ) (2,047 ) (1,732 ) Cash used in financing activities (784 ) (752 ) (75 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 54 $ (204 ) $ 450 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Higher income in 2006 generated the increased cash provided by operating activities, which was partially offset by higher income tax payments, $150 million in voluntary pension contributions, higher material and supply inventories, and higher management incentive payments in 2006. Higher income, lower management incentive payments in 2005 (executive bonuses, which would have been paid to individuals in 2005, were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce that were paid out in 2005 were significantly reduced), and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005. A voluntary pension contribution of $100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive year over year variance in 2005 as no pension contribution was made in 2005. This improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds. Cash Used in Investing Activities An insurance settlement for the 2005 January West Coast storm and lower balances for work in process decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2006. Higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease. Increased capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales, increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004. Cash Used in Financing Activities The increase in cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans ($189 million in 2006 compared to $262 million in 2005). The increase in 2005 results from debt issuances in 2004 and higher debt repayments in 2005. We did not issue debt in 2005 versus $745 million of debt issuances in 2004, and we repaid $699 million of debt in 2005 compared to $588 million in 2004. The higher outflows in 2005 were partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans ($262 million in 2005 compared to $80 million in 2004). 30 Table of Contents The table below details cash capital investments for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Track $ 1,487 $ 1,472 $ 1,328 Capacity and commercial facilities 510 509 347 Locomotives and freight cars 135 98 125 Other 110 90 76 Total $ 2,242 $ 2,169 $ 1,876 In 2007, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.2 billion, which may include long term leases. These investments will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. We designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety, enhance customer service, promote growth, and improve operational fluidity. We expect to fund our 2007 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2006. We expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 4.4, 2.9, and 2.1, respectively. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher net income. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. See Exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. Financing Activities Credit Facilities On December 31, 2006, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five year facility expiring in March 2009 and $1 billion under a five year facility expiring in March 2010 (collectively, the "facilities"). The facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. Neither of the facilities were drawn on in 2006. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers. These facilities allow for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. The facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. In addition to our revolving credit facilities, we had $150 million in uncommitted lines of credit available, including $75 million that expires in March 2007 and $75 million expiring in May 2007. Neither of these lines of credit were used as of December 31, 2006. We must have equivalent credit available under our five year facilities to draw on these $75 million lines. Dividends On January 30, 2007, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, payable beginning on April 2, 2007, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2007. We expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2006. Dividend Restrictions We are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities. Retained earnings available 31 Table of Contents for dividends increased to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2006, from $6.2 billion at December 31, 2005. We do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Common Stock Repurchases On January 30, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock through December 31, 2009. We may make these repurchases on the open market or through other transactions. Our management will have sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions. We expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2006. Shelf Registration Statement Under a current shelf registration statement, we may issue any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2006, we had $500 million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue any securities; however, we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue debt securities at any time. Operating Lease Activities As of December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately $5.5 billion. Discounted at 8%, the present value of this obligation was approximately $3.5 billion. The Railroad, as lessee, entered into long term operating lease arrangements during 2006 to finance the majority of its new equipment acquisitions. In 2006, the lessors under these lease arrangements purchased 200 locomotives and 2,100 freight cars from the Corporation through various financing transactions with a total equipment cost of approximately $523 million and a present value of $427 million. These new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately $777 million and are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of December 31, 2006. The lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars, in part, by the issuance of equipment notes that are non recourse to the Railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the various types of equipment. Neither the Railroad nor UPC guarantees payment of the equipment notes. The Railroads obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars. If the Railroad does not exercise any such options, the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As described in the notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings, and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry. 32 Table of Contents The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Millions of Dollars Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After2011 Debt [a] $ 9,102 $ 1,035 $ 880 $ 693 $ 606 $ 656 $ 5,232 Operating leases 5,457 624 546 498 456 419 2,914 Capital lease obligations [b] 1,916 180 173 168 148 157 1,090 Purchase obligations [c] 4,516 1,362 573 502 248 199 1,632 Other post retirement benefits [d] 298 27 28 29 31 31 152 Total contractual obligations $ 21,289 $ 3,228 $ 2,200 $ 1,890 $ 1,489 $ 1,462 $ 11,020 [a] Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,236 million, unamortized discount of $103 million, and market value adjustments of $14 million for debt with qualifying hedges that are recorded as liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

[c] Includes guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. [d] None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Receivables The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse on a 364 day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by $1,158 million and $1,226 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $558 million and $626 million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction. 33 Table of Contents The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility. The Railroad services the sold receivables; however, the Railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $15.5 billion and $13.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. UPRI used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility. The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $33 million, $23 million, and $11 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. The investors have no recourse to the Railroads other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no recourse to the assets of UPRI. In August 2006, the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364 day period without any significant changes in terms. Guarantees At December 31, 2006, we were contingently liable for $464 million in guarantees. We have recognized a $6 million liability for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2006. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. OTHER MATTERS Inflation The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts. Derivative Financial Instruments We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements. Market and Credit Risk We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities. 34 Table of Contents Determination of Fair Value We determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows. Sensitivity Analyses The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results. Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities. Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of $500 million and $750 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had variable rate debt representing approximately 7% and 10%, respectively, of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2007 than our December 31, 2006 variable rate, which was approximately 8%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $5 million. If variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2006 than our December 31, 2005 variable rate, which was approximately 7%, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $7 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2006, and amounts to approximately $462 million at December 31, 2006. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2005, amounted to approximately $535 million at December 31, 2005. We estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates. Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At December 31, 2006, we had a reduction of $5 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding. Fuel Cash Flow Hedges Fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2006 and 2005, our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs. However, we may use swaps, collars, futures and or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. We did not have any fuel hedges in place during 2006 or 2005. We hedged 120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap, floor, and ceiling prices of $0.74, $0.64, and $0.86 per gallon, respectively. Fuel Swaps We entered into two fuel basis swaps for the period August 2006 through July 2008, which cover a total of 151 million gallons of diesel fuel. These commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to, 35 Table of Contents or receive payments from, the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices. Changes in the fair value of these swaps are reflected in fuel expense. We reported a derivative asset of approximately $2 million at December 31, 2006, which represents the fair value of the swaps. The swaps reduced fuel expense for 2006 by $3 million, which included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the fair value recognition at December 31, 2006. Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Under the interpretation, we will recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized will be measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The interpretation is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be a one time reduction in the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Future changes in uncertain tax positions will be included in income tax expense. We do not expect that the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (FAS 157). While this statement does not require new fair value measurements, it provides guidance on applying fair value and expands required disclosures. FAS 157 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2008. We are currently assessing the impact FAS 157 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). FAS 158 required us to recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the balance sheet, along with a corresponding noncash, after tax adjustment to shareholders equity. Funded status is determined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. Changes in the funded status will be recognized in other comprehensive loss. We adopted FAS 158 at the end of 2006 and have disclosed the impact of the adoption in note 7 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement and balance sheet approach and then evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. If prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial are now considered material based on either approach, no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered. If prior years financial statements are not restated, the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings (deficit) as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. SAB 108 was effective for us at the end of 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). This statement, which is expected to expand fair value measurement, permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. FAS 159 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2008. We are currently assessing the impact FAS 159 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Asserted and Unasserted Claims Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time for us to determine fully the effect of all unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded 36 Table of Contents a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters. Indemnities Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions. Insurance Subsidiaries We have two consolidated, wholly owned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks, including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. Asbestos We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. During 2004, we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability. As a result of this assessment, we increased our liability in 2004 for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through 2034. This liability excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions: The number of future claims received would be consistent with historical averages. The number of claims filed against us will decline each year. The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages. The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages. Our asbestos related liabilities were $302 million and $311 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The current portion of asbestos related liabilities was $13 million and $16 million, respectively. Approximately 16% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 28 years. We have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims, and, as a result of the 2004 assessment, we increased our receivable for insurance recoveries related to asbestos during 2004. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2006 and 2005. 37 Table of Contents Our asbestos related claims activity was as follows: Claims Activity 2006 2005 2004 Open claims, beginning balance 2,435 2,316 2,560 New claims 316 741 474 Settled or dismissed claims (474 ) (622 ) (718 ) Open claims, ending balance at December 31 2,277 2,435 2,316 During 2006 and 2005 our third party consultants assisted us in reviewing our actual asbestos claim experience compared to the assumptions used in the 2004 estimate, and we determined that no adjustment was necessary. We will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted. We believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes to strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation, federal and state law governing litigation and compensation of asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants. Environmental We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We identified 367 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 44 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 25 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site. Our environmental site activity was as follows: Site Activity 2006 2005 2004 Open sites, beginning balance 370 384 417 New sites 50 56 59 Closed sites (53 ) (70 ) (92 ) Open sites, ending balance at December 31 367 370 384 When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Environmental expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $39 million, $45 million, and $46 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a liability of $210 million and $213 million, respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $54 million and $46 million, respectively, were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other 38 Table of Contents potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Personal Injury The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third party actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for personal injury related events were $240 million in 2006, $247 million in 2005, and $288 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had accrued liabilities of $631 million and $619 million for future personal injury costs, respectively, of which $233 million and $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs, respectively. Our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable U.S. Treasury rates. Approximately 87% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims, and approximately 13% related to unasserted claims. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation. Our personal injury claims activity was as follows: Claims Activity 2006 2005 2004 Open claims, beginning balance 4,197 4,028 4,085 New claims 4,190 4,584 4,366 Settled or dismissed claims (4,261 ) (4,415 ) (4,423 ) Open claims, ending balance at December 31 4,126 4,197 4,028 Depreciation The railroad industry is capital intensive. Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group, based on the results of internal depreciation studies. We are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the STB for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period. Significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Cash capital spending totaled $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation expense was $1.2 billion. We use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $43 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $45 million. Income Taxes As required under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These 39 Table of Contents expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $245 million. When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part on managements judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events. Based on that analysis, we recorded a valuation allowance of $5 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005. There was no valuation allowance as of December 31, 2006. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate. We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors: Discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans expected benefit payments. Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and OPEB expense for 2006 and the estimated impact on 2006 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in those assumptions: Assumptions Pension OPEB Discount rate 5.75 % 5.75 % Salary increase 2.75 % N/A Expected return on plan assets 8.00 % N/A Healthcare cost trend rate: Current N/A 9.00 % Level in 2010 N/A 5.00 % Sensitivities Increasein Expense Millions of Dollars Pension OPEB 0.25% decrease in discount rate $ 6 $ 0.25% increase in salary scale $ 1 N/A 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets $ 4 N/A 1% increase in healthcare cost trend rate N/A $ 5 40 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY INFORMATION Certain statements in this report, and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us), are, or will be, forward looking statements as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
