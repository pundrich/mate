item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states as of october we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings finance charges on installment sale contracts for cemetery property and trust management fees we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale general for fiscal year we generated million in revenue and million in gross profit our highest revenue and gross profit in four years we increased cemetery gross profit by percent and funeral gross profit by percent while expanding cemetery gross profit margin by basis points and funeral gross profit margin by basis points we produced the highest annual cemetery property and preneed funeral production in five years earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year were million compared to million for fiscal year fiscal year results included an after tax benefit of million from our successful settlement of our hurricane katrina litigation earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were for fiscal years and our fiscal year results reflect an increase in cemetery revenue and a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures we generated million in operating cash flow during fiscal year and maintained our strong balance sheet with million of cash and marketable securities on hand and no amounts borrowed on our million senior secured revolving credit facility at fiscal year end during fiscal year we repurchased million shares of our outstanding class a common stock for million these purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program have resulted in a percent decrease in total shares outstanding in the last twelve months also during fiscal year we announced a percent increase in our annual dividend to per share and returned million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends or per share in fiscal year we began a program of developing cremation gardens and other cremation projects in our cemeteries we have successfully completed cremation projects and we currently have projects under construction and approximately additional projects currently under feasibility review we spent million in fiscal year on these projects compared to million in fiscal year and plan to spend approximately to million in fiscal year cemetery cremation sales improved percent in fiscal year compared to fiscal year highlighting the positive returns on our ongoing cremation initiative additional information about our business and strategies can be found in item business in the second quarter we announced an organizational restructuring and workforce reduction the organizational changes involve a restructure of the sales organization and realignment of our geographic regions and regional management to better integrate operations and sales the restructure of our sales organization focuses on providing more efficient and effective sales strategy management mentoring training and recruiting with the ultimate goals of improving customer service and increasing sales the new organization reduces the layers of sales management and is designed to provide increased opportunities for sales employees during the beginning of fiscal year we will finalize our sales force restructuring by implementing changes that primarily impact our customer facing sales force including changing our compensation structure separate from the changes related to the sales organization we also announced in the second quarter a reduction of our workforce by approximately employees primarily within our corporate support services the combined effect of our organizational restructuring and workforce reduction is expected to produce annual savings of approximately million table of contents our trust earnings continue to be impacted by the volatility in the financial markets the adverse financial market conditions throughout the latter part of fiscal year and the early part of fiscal year caused a decrease in our revenue from trust activities from fiscal years through we recognized million million million million and million respectively in revenue from trust related activities during fiscal years through our trust portfolios had total returns of percent percent percent percent and percent respectively in our preneed trusts and percent percent percent percent and percent respectively in our cemetery perpetual care trusts financial summary for fiscal year for fiscal year we reported net earnings of million earnings from continuing operations of million or per diluted share total revenue of million and total gross profit of million our net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax charge due to the organizational restructuring and a separate reduction in workforce occurring primarily in the second quarter of the fiscal year in addition during fiscal year we sold one of our e commerce businesses resulting in a net loss from discontinued operations of million for fiscal year we reported net earnings of million earnings from continuing operations of million or per diluted share total revenue of million and total gross profit of million our net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax insurance settlement related to the successful resolution of our litigation related to hurricane katrina damages and a million million after tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt as a result of the refinancing of our senior notes and revolving credit facility in april cemetery revenue improved million or percent to million for the year ended october cemetery property sales improved million or percent compared to fiscal year in addition revenue related to trust activities increased by million and merchandise delivered and services performed increased by million these improvements were partially offset by a million decline in finance charges as a result of reduced interest rates in this low interest rate environment and a million decrease in revenue recognized for cemetery property sales for which the property was not yet constructed or the down payment required for revenue recognition was not yet received we generated million in funeral revenue during fiscal year a million decline from fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a percent decline in same store funeral services performed which we believe is consistent with industry wide data in our markets the decline in funeral services was partially offset by a percent improvement in same store average revenue per funeral service our net preneed funeral sales increased percent during fiscal year compared to fiscal year preneed funeral sales are deferred until a future period and have no impact on current revenue cemetery gross profit increased million or percent to million for the year ended october the increase in gross profit is primarily due to the improvement in revenue as previously noted as well as a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures earlier this year cemetery gross profit margin improved basis points to percent for fiscal year from percent for fiscal year funeral gross profit increased million or percent to million for fiscal year the improvement in gross profit is primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures earlier this year as well as an improvement in our insurance claims experience funeral gross profit margin improved basis points to percent for fiscal year from percent for fiscal year during fiscal year we announced a percent increase in our annual dividend to per share from per share we paid million in dividends to our shareholders in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year throughout fiscal year we repurchased million shares of our outstanding class a common stock for million as of october we had million remaining under our million stock repurchase program our weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to million shares for fiscal year compared to million shares for fiscal year this decrease is primarily a result of our stock repurchase program which yielded a positive impact on our earnings per share purchases of class a common stock under our share repurchase program have resulted in a percent decrease in total shares outstanding in the last twelve months table of contents cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decline in cash flow is primarily due to million of the hurricane katrina settlement received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the third quarter of our board of directors appointed dr john b elstrott jr to the newly created position of lead independent director among his primary responsibilities as lead independent director dr elstrott will act as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the ceo assist the ceo and the chairman of the board with developing board agendas and preside at board meetings and executive sessions of the independent directors preneed backlog trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with the retail land sale provisions of asc property plant and equipment for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales preneed sales and trust earnings see notes i j k and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october and the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog represented approximately billion and billion respectively of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are ultimately delivered this is made up of approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance as of october and approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance as of october this represents the face value of the backlog taking into account unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses including impairments on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the current face value of insurance contracts it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our historical experience with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years in addition in fiscal years and the analysis assumes a weighted average annual return of approximately percent and percent respectively projected from our trusts over the expected life of the contracts and zero percent for increasing death benefits on insurance contracts actual results could differ materially from our assumptions used in the calculation proceeds of these insurance policies may be used by customers for other purposes and are portable to other funeral service providers or for completely separate purposes supplemental trust portfolio information we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services preneed cemetery merchandise and services together with the preneed funeral merchandise and services trust preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care the size of the trusts depends primarily upon the level of preneed sales and maturities the amount of dividend and interest income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions if any as of october approximately percent of our trust portfolio was invested in cash percent in equities percent in fixed income securities percent in preferred stock percent in each of real estate index funds commodity index funds and master limited partnership index funds and percent in other investments our trust portfolios and trust earnings continue to be impacted by volatility in the financial markets and contain a substantial proportion of equity securities the equity securities have generally experienced increases and decreases in value commensurate with the overall financial markets table of contents during fiscal year we realized aggregate net losses of million in our preneed trusts and recorded a million tax valuation allowance in addition we realized aggregate net losses of million in our cemetery perpetual care trusts we recorded a related charge for the estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of million in certain of our cemetery perpetual care trusts at their lowest quarter end point our trust portfolios reached a net unrealized loss position of million as of january as of october we recorded other than temporary impairments of million in our preneed trusts and million in our perpetual care trusts and reduced the cost basis of the related securities to fair market value these losses and impairments had no impact on our balance sheet as the securities and corresponding liabilities are already recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet however the losses and impairments in our preneed trusts were allocated to the underlying contracts and will be recognized as the services and merchandise are performed and delivered in the future reducing the revenues and gross profits we would otherwise have realized related to those contracts after these losses and impairments and an overall improvement in the market our net unrealized loss position was million as of october during late fiscal we reviewed alternative asset allocation models and selected new asset allocation goals that emphasize diversification and reduce volatility we have taken advantage of the improvement in the overall markets to adjust our asset allocation towards these goals currently percent of our portfolio is invested in asset classes that were not represented in our trusts just three years ago including real estate investment trusts high yield mutual funds and master limited partnerships among others we have been investing in proportionately more exchange tradedindex funds and fewer individual equities we continuously evaluate our investment strategies to maintain an asset allocation that provides consistent returns with appropriate risk the long term objectives are to preserve principal while seeking appropriate levels of current income and capital appreciation in order to provide returns that match inflation plus a reasonable return the following table presents the annual realized return in our trusts for fiscal years through the returns represent interest dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses the following table presents the annual total returns in our trusts for fiscal years through including realized and unrealized gains and losses the following table presents the total returns of our preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts including realized and unrealized gains and losses for the periods indicated preneed trusts cemetery perpetualcare trusts for the year ended october for three years ended october for five years ended october for ten years ended october during fiscal years and we experienced positive trends in the overall market and in our preneed and perpetual care trusts for the years ended october and our preneed trusts experienced a total return including both realized and unrealized losses of percent and percent respectively and our cemetery perpetual care trusts experienced a total return including both realized and unrealized losses of percent and percent respectively in our preneed trusts the fair market value of the investments in the trusts were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october and october respectively in our cemetery perpetual care trusts the fair market value of our investments were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october and october respectively for additional information see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item the cost basis of our trust assets reflect the price we originally paid for the securities reduced for other than temporary impairments we have recorded pursuant to gaap table of contents we believe that the trust investments will appreciate in value over the long term we continue to monitor our investment portfolio closely although we have significant unrealized and unallocated losses in our trust portfolio as of october and october we had million and million respectively in trust earnings net of losses that have been realized and allocated to contracts that will be recognized in the future as the underlying contracts are performed securities with unrealized losses totaling million at october were also in a loss position at october down from million at the end of the last fiscal year for additional information see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position and whether a charge to earnings to record a liability for any expected losses is required no charge has ever been required for additional information see note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item and overview of critical accounting policies we generate revenue related to the trusts from investment management fees earned by our subsidiary iti during fiscal years through these fees amounted to million million million million and million respectively these fees are based on the fair market value of the investments in the preneed trust portfolio and the cemetery perpetual care trusts significant changes in the fair market value of the

information technology healthcare services risks associated with the financial services sector include risk of failure of various large financial institutions changing government regulation interest

products competition and government regulation the healthcares services sector risks include the failure of research and development products class action litigation related to adverse side effects changes in the level of us government funding for medicare and medicaid the loss of patent protection on existing pharmaceutical drugs and the impact of the patient protection and affordable care act impact of preneed sales on near term cash the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale the timing of the tax payments on the sale whether the sale is funded by trust or insurance the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contracts such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust therefore we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer accordingly preneed trust sales are generally cash flow negative initially but may become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract generally preneed insurance sales are slightly cash flow positive as commissions received generally exceed the commissions paid to sales counselors commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred cash flows related to earnings in our trusts deposits and withdrawals and related matters and our cemetery perpetual care funding obligations are described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements included in item overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and assumptions we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgment see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are ultimately performed our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts which include accumulated trust earnings are deferred until such time that the funeral services are ultimately performed see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item table of contents revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is ultimately performed or merchandise is actually delivered revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of asc property plant and equipment under this guidance revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until percent of the sales price has been collected revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to completion of its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by our preneed trusts including impairments until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered unrealized capital gains and losses are not allocated to specific contracts from time to time unidentified contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses in addition from time to time we have identified in our backlog certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered using historical trends and statistical analysis we have recorded an estimated net debit for these items perpetual care funding obligation certain states allow us to withdraw realized capital gains from cemetery perpetual care trusts while other states prohibit these withdrawals these earnings and related funds are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs and are recorded as revenue in the event that we have been allowed to withdraw realized gains from the trust and then realize net losses in the trust we may determine we have a funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of the trust a charge is recorded in the statement of earnings at the time it is considered probable that we will be required to restore the realized losses loss contract analysis each quarter we perform an analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position which would necessitate a charge to earnings for this analysis we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and realized earnings then subtract realized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts as of that particular balance sheet date we then consider unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis we compare the amount of adjusted proceeds after considering net unrealized gains and losses to the estimated direct costs to deliver the contracts which consist primarily of funeral and cemetery merchandise costs and salaries supplies and equipment related to the delivery of a preneed contract if a deficiency were to exist we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our deferred revenue due to the positive margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have experienced in prior years there is currently sufficient capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would occur no such charges have ever been recorded variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts for a more detailed discussion of our related accounting policies see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not recorded on our balance sheet as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item determination of whether securities held in trusts are other than temporarily impaired we have significant unrealized losses in certain securities held in our trust portfolios determining whether these losses are temporary or other than temporary is inherently subjective to determine whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary we analyze the securities on an individual trust account basis as well as a security by security basis the evaluation first considers whether we have sufficient liquidity within each individual trust account to hold the investments in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time the liquidity assessment of the individual trust accounts includes estimates of annual trust income historical deposits and table of contents withdrawals cash balances upcoming debt investment maturities and other liquidity alternatives we also evaluate consensus analyst recommendations concerns specific to the issuer overall market performance and annual returns required to recover the loss we also evaluate whether we have the intent to hold the security until it recovers in value if we determine that an unrealized loss is other than temporary we must write down the cost basis of the impaired security to fair value at that time which would generally be the current trading price any subsequent recovery in fair value cannot be recognized until the security is sold any losses realized from other than temporary impairments of securities held in our trusts generally would have no immediate impact on our balance sheet because our trust portfolio securities are already carried at fair market value on our balance sheet in our preneed trusts losses from other than temporary impaired securities generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues margins earnings or cash flow however such losses would be allocated to the underlying contracts and would have an adverse impact on the amount of future revenue recognized from the trusts at the time the specific contract is ultimately performed accordingly a determination that any significant losses in these trust portfolios are other than temporary could have a material adverse effect on our future trust earnings in our cemetery perpetual care trusts such losses generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues margins earnings or cash flow unless the losses caused us to realize a probable funding obligation as described in item a risk factors and overview of critical accounting policies perpetual care funding obligation allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories these percentages are based on an analysis of our historical collection and write off experience in addition we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance and third party commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability these estimates are impacted by a number of factors including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation if circumstances change our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives primarily using the straight line method buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years equipment is generally depreciated over the following ranges light equipment to years heavy equipment years computer equipment and software to years and crematory equipment to years vehicles are generally depreciated over to years leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations table of contents valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not our operating regions are considered economically similar qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services consistency of products and services and the delivery of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions based on our evaluation we have eleven reporting units because goodwill impairment tests are applied at the reporting unit level a change in a reporting unit can have a material effect on the outcome of the test see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in addition to an annual review we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends goodwill was allocated to these reporting units based on the implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination that is we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill we calculate the fair value or enterprise value for each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow analysis as supplemented by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda we also review multiples paid in recent acquisition transactions within the deathcare industry in fiscal year we adopted guidance that simplified the testing for goodwill impairment the guidance permits an entity to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if performing the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary in april we announced an organizational restructuring and a separate workforce reduction the organizational changes involved a restructure of the sales organization and realignment of our geographic regions and regional management due to the realignment of certain regions we evaluated the economic similarity of our regions and determined that two of our funeral reporting units were impacted by this change our former southeastern region was split in two with the northern part of the region forming the new southeastern region and the southern part of the region combining with the former puerto rico region to form the new south floridapuerto rico region for these two funeral reporting units which have a combined goodwill balance of million we proceeded directly to step one of the impairment test and performed a quantitative analysis which was performed due to the fact these are two new regions and a previous analysis was not available this reorganization required a reallocation of goodwill from a qualitative perspective in evaluating whether it is more likely than not ie a probability of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount relevant events and circumstances were taken into account with greater weight assigned to events and circumstances that most affect a reporting units fair value or the carrying amounts of its assets items that were considered include but are not limited to the following macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions costs of merchandise or labor overall financial performance other entity specific events such as changes in management or key personnel events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition of net assets or an expected disposition and a change in our share price in addition we also considered recent fair value calculations for each reporting unit and determined that there was a significant difference between fair value and the carrying amount after assessing these and other factors we determined that is was more likely than not that the fair value of all of our reporting units was greater than the carrying amounts table of contents for the two reporting units for which we performed a quantitative analysis we determined that goodwill was not impaired the goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment we determined the fair value of the reporting units based on present value techniques including discounted cash flows the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows in projecting our cash flows we used growth rates generally ranging from one to five percent in revenues and costs and also considered additional cremation gardens and other mausoleum projects that are currently under construction for the discount rate we used percent which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry suppliers and capital structure as adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years the terminal value is calculated as the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period divided by the discount rate minus terminal growth rates ranging from to percent we prepared a sensitivity analysis of the terminal values and used the midpoint enterprise value as our best estimate accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal state and united states possessions capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal state and united states possessions to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change in this allowance in a period we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of earnings approximately percent of the october fair market value of our preneed trusts are in trusts for which the company is the grantor for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust for example capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns in addition we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes while for book purposes they are deferred realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains may require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings essentially the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that if we cannot generate sufficient capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years when we perform the contract we will pay higher taxes this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed during the first quarter of fiscal year we adopted the guidance on uncertain tax positions in asc income taxes this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain with few exceptions we are no longer subject to us federal state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before to the extent tax interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions in the future amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of tax expense interest expense or other expense significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to change our allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations table of contents estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductibleself insured retention premium rating program this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies but below our deductible with respect to health insurance we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance we also have insurance coverage related to property damage incremental costs and property operating expenses we incur due to damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters our policy is to record such amounts when recovery is probable which generally means we have reached an agreement with the insurance company for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item results of operations the following discussion segregates the financial results of our continuing operations into our three segments

respectively funeral trust earnings recognized in funeral revenue for fiscal years and with respect to preneed contracts delivered were and million respectively funeral revenue declined million or percent to million for fiscal year this decline is primarily due to a percent decrease in same store funeral services which we believe is consistent with industry wide data in our markets this decrease was partially offset by a percent improvement in same store average revenue per funeral service the cremation rate for our same store operations was percent for the year ended october compared to percent for the year ended october funeral gross profit increased million or percent to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the improvement in gross profit is primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures as well

convertible notes in the open market that occurred through fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the increased rate in fiscal year is primarily due to a million charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to a change in puerto rican tax legislation

collected on preneed sales that are not required to be placed in trust and items such as cemetery perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges over the last five years we have generated more than million annually in cash flow from operations we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash flows from operations we believe that our current level of cash on hand projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under the million senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future as of

november had million remaining available under the program repurchases under the program are limited to our class a common stock and are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate depending upon market conditions and other factors we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise we believe that the use of our cash to make acquisitions of death care businesses pay dividends repurchase debt and stock invest in our strategic initiatives and construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or on our own strategic locations are all attractive options we are continuing to invest in further improving our business processes and continue to look at ways to improve our organization and cost structure in fiscal year we began a program of developing cremation gardens and other cremation projects in our cemeteries we have successfully completed cremation projects and we currently have projects either under construction or expected to begin construction and approximately additional projects under feasibility review for the year ended october we spent million on these projects compared to million in fiscal year and we plan to spend approximately million to million in fiscal year as of october we had no material commitments for capital expenditures table of contents we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions remains a good business strategy as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities which may require us to draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility or pursue additional debt or equity financing during the year ended october we invested million of available cash for the acquisition of two funeral businesses and during the year ended october we invested million of available cash for the acquisition of two funeral homecemetery combinations we received internal revenue service approval in fiscal year on five requests for changes in tax accounting methods which resulted in the deferral of approximately million of taxable income these changes increased the amounts available to offset taxable income beginning in to approximately million these changes primarily relate to our tax accounting methods for preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral merchandise these changes permit us to defer the recognition of income for tax purposes and payment of taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is provided or the merchandise is actually delivered we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future in fiscal year we received approval from the internal revenue service for a change in tax accounting method resulting in the deferral of approximately million in revenue until the service is performed or merchandise is delivered thereby increasing the amount available to reduce taxable income this increase resulted or will result in approximately million of reduced tax payments we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million when the related preneed contracts are performed in the future as a result of the tax accounting changes that took place in fiscal years through described above we had approximately million available to offset taxable income as of we were able to utilize approximately million in fiscal year million in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year which reduced federal income taxes paid by approximately million million and million respectively we are continuing to review all of our tax accounting methods to determine opportunities to further improve our current tax position several possible changes are being considered that could result in potential reductions in future tax payments at this time we cannot predict with certainty what if any reductions in future tax payments we will obtain however we currently do not expect that these potential reductions in future tax payments if obtained will be as substantial as those obtained in fiscal years through which resulted in a combination of refunds and reductions of federal income tax payments totaling in excess of million based on the currently approved changes we expect to have federal net operating losses available in fiscal year to offset a portion of federal income taxes for fiscal years and we expect our federal cash tax payments to be approximately million to million above fiscal year amounts cash flow comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decline in cash flow is primarily due to million of the hurricane katrina settlement received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october compared to a net cash outflow of million for fiscal year the change is primarily due to a million net change related to

dividends paid increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the receipt of million of the hurricane katrina settlement during the fourth quarter of in addition we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year primarily driven by the timing of trust withdrawals and deposits partially offset by an increase in inventory and receivables these increases are due in part to the improved cemetery property sales which are typically financed our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october compared to a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october the change is primarily due to a million net change related to purchases and sales of certificates of deposits marketable securities and restricted cash

period contingent obligations total less than year years years more than years cemetery perpetual care trust funding obligations long term obligations related to uncertain tax positions in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past from our cemetery perpetual care trusts regulators may seek replenishment of subsequent realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they restore the initial corpus the estimated probable funding obligation in the cemetery perpetual care trusts in these states was million as of october as of october we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states that could be subject to a future funding obligation because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn we believe it is reasonably possible but
