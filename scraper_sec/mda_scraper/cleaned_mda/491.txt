income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations sfas no accounting for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods as of december the company had determined that it was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of million of its deferred tax assets would not be realized the company had therefore recorded a cumulative million valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting purposes as of december the valuation allowance was determined based on the companys review of its future estimated us taxable income levels and the estimated future stock option exercises included in this million valuation allowance was million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options as required by sfas no and apb opinion no accounting for stock issued to employees the company had originally recorded all million of these future tax benefits as increased additional paid in capital accordingly when the company recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax benefits the company also reduced additional paid in capital by million as required by sfas no the company maintained this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined during that it was more likely than not that it would realize the actual tax benefit of million of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been previously provided the company made this determination based on the level of the companys actual us taxable income the companys projected future us taxable income levels the companys actual tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options and the fact that the companys future tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options would most likely be less than in the past as those options which were significantly in the money were expiring and exercised by december the company therefore recorded in a million reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance because this reduction in the valuation allowance included million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options the company also restored million to the companys additional paid in capital in in accordance with sfas no and apb no the remaining balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the company made in the company made the determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time litigation as described in item of part i of this form k the company is a party to various pending litigation matters with respect to each pending claim management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and if so the probable range of that loss if and when management has determined with respect to a particular claim both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation with respect to the claims referenced in item management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading hewlett packard company as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the companys results of operation

plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the companys benefit obligation and expense at the end of each year the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moodys aa interest rate as of december that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits once the interest rates were determined the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date at december the company determined this rate to be for the companys us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the companys benefit obligation and expense retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions a one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the companys net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the companys net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no r share based payment on january

recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stock based compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be materially impacted as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas no r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no r the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas no r and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years under the modified transition method compensation costs associated with awards for now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december the company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method the after tax stock based compensation and the impact to
