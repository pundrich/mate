item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we design develop and sell digital video processing systems that enable telephony based service providers to deliver broadcast quality digital video signals across their networks we refer to these systems as digital tv headends or video content processing systems we also offer digital video processing systems that enable private enterprise and government entities to transport video signals across satellite fiber radio or copper facilities for surveillance distance learning and tv production applications we also offer broadband transport and service management products that enable the provisioning of high speed internet access and other broadband data services over existing copper networks within hotels and private campus facilities our history historically we derived most of our sales from our broadband transport and service management products in november we acquired videotelecom referred to in this report as vtc from tektronix inc to extend our product offerings to include digital video processing systems on june we acquired copper mountain networks inc referred to in this report as copper mountain for its technology and engineering resources which we have refocused to further address our expanding video market opportunities for delivering advanced video services over coax and fiber networks we earn revenue primarily by selling video content processing systems both directly and through resellers to telecommunications service providers we also earn revenue by selling video transmission systems to tv broadcasters and governments and by selling broadband transport and service management products directly and through distributors to the hospitality industry and to owners of private multi tenant campus facilities during the years ended december and international sales represented and of our total sales respectively material trends and uncertainties we pay close attention to and monitor various trends and uncertainties about our business there is a growing demand by independent operating telephone companies to offer video services to their customer base according to a recent release from infonetics research in november the number of iptv subscribers worldwide is expected to grow to over million by the end of while this growing market presents opportunities to serve a larger customer base we are also encountering increasing competition as more companies compete to sell digital tv headend products we expect this market space will continue to become more competitive in the future our immediate competitors in the digital tv headend markets have been primarily small private companies that were focused on a narrower product line than ours and thereby may have been able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing marketing and selling new products than we are able to certain of these companies have become targets for acquisition by larger companies in which case we may face competitors with substantially greater name recognition and technical financial and marketing resources than we have this increased competitive pressure may adversely affect the amount and timing of our revenue in future periods thereby making it more difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and may also adversely affect our product margins the emergence of new technologies to serve the digital tv headend market means that we must continue to invest in these technologies to remain competitive digital subscriber line or dsl technologies use sophisticated signal blending techniques to transmit data through copper wires the limitations on the amount of table of contents data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time such limitations are referred to as bandwidth and the distance data may be transmitted using copper wire constrain both the number of video channels that may be delivered simultaneously and the number of customers that are reachable from a telco central office over a dsl network advancements in video compression technology are now enabling high quality video streams to be transported at lower data transfer rates than has been previously available these compression advancements also allow for the delivery of high definition television over bandwidth constrained asymmetric dsl or adsl lines for the first time adsl is a technology that allows more data to be transmitted over existing copper telephone lines compared with standard dsl additionally dsl advancements are emerging that expand the available bandwidth from the telco to the subscriber thereby supporting higher dsl data transfer rates over longer distances as our products continue to incorporate new technological advancements we expect the demand for our products will increase because our products will enable more telcos to reach more of their customers with a greater number of video channels and features over their dsl networks however because of the increasing competition in the markets in which we compete regardless of our revenue and product margins in future periods we will continue to devote significant resources to research and development in future periods in order to enable us to offer our customers competitive products that incorporate these emerging technologies as a consequence we expect our research and development expenses in to be comparable to the research and development expenditures we incurred in as we continue to capitalize on the growing number of telcos deploying video services in the united states and abroad we will continue to aggressively market our new and existing products and expand our marketing and sales efforts domestically and internationally nevertheless our sales activities have been and will continue to be subject to competitive market pressure we believe that in certain competitive markets our prospective customer purchase decisions continue to be impacted by lengthening of the purchase decision because of several factors that are affecting the overall digital tv headend market such factors include but are not limited to the delays in the introduction of advanced compression technology set top boxes the transition to more efficient data transmission technologies and the emergence of video signal encryption requirements nevertheless given the opportunities offered by the growing number of our target customers deploying or enhancing video services and despite the length of the sales cycle we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in compared to our spending in internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures evaluation of fiscal year our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december based on this evaluation they concluded as of december that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting definitions for discussion of results of operations our discussion of our results of operations focuses on the following items from our income statement total revenues consists of product sales and license and royalty fees revenue consists of sales of our video processing systems which includes both digital tv headend and video transmission systems revenue also consists of revenue from our broadband transport and service management products since our acquisition of vtc a large part of our revenue has been associated with the sale of digital tv headends furthermore each individual headend sale has represented a significant portion of our revenue if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales our revenue would be materially impacted as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during or we expect minimal future license and royalty revenue cost of goods sold or cogs consists of costs related to raw materials contract manufacturing personnel overhead test and quality assurance for products and the cost of licensed technology included in our table of contents products raw materials contract manufacturing and licensed technology are the principal elements of cogs and vary directly with product sales sales and marketing expense consists primarily of selling and marketing personnel costs including sales commissions facilities travel trade shows promotions and outside services research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and facilities costs contract consultants outside testing services and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for administrative officers and support personnel facilities professional services and insurance expenses amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of expenses associated with the amortization of technology and patents related to acquisitions results of operations years ended december and our acquisition of copper mountain has had a significant impact on every aspect of our financial statements since june this impact is reflected in the following discussion of our operating results this should be considered when evaluating our period to period comparisons of relative to years prior to the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of assets amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations gain on sale of investments interest and other income expense net net loss total revenues for the year ended december our total revenue increased by to million from million for the year ended december we operate in a single business segment across two related markets we measure our revenue by our two product lines only and therefore are unable to further quantify the impact of individual products on our revenue during this same period our revenue from video processing systems increased by to million from million for the year ended december during we experienced an increased demand for our video processing systems from independent operating telephone companies and international post telephone and telegraph companies compared to we believe the increase in video processing systems revenue was due primarily to the increased market acceptance and the resulting increased demand for our products that address the iptv market in certain prospective customers indicated to us that they were delaying their purchase decisions for a variety of factors including their anticipation of the introduction and general availability of advanced compression technologies in we introduced our upgraded astria video processing systems that table of contents incorporates these anticipated technologies known as motion pictures experts group mpeg advanced video compression technologies or mpeg avc as a result our upgraded astria products enable our customers to address a larger percentage of their geographic market and deliver advanced video services we expect our revenue from video processing systems to increase in when compared to as we continue to introduce additional features to our astria products including high definition products to new customers and as an upgrade option to our installed base revenue from the sale of our broadband transport and service management products decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in broadband transport and service management revenue was primarily the result of customers choosing competing products that transmit data via wireless data transmission technologies instead of our products which transmit data over telephone wires the year over year decrease in our broadband transport and service management revenue is primarily due to the end of the product lifecycle for these products revenue from this product line is expected to increase in future quarters with the introduction of our next generation products expected late in the first quarter of legacy product sales from the june acquisition of copper mountain networks were million for the year ended december we do not anticipate additional significant revenue from these products for the year ended december our revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december during this same period our revenue from video processing systems decreased by to million from million for the year ended december as discussed earlier we experienced a slowing demand for our video processing systems from independent operating telephone companies during compared to we believe the decrease in video processing systems revenue was primarily due to the adverse effect of several digital tv headend sales not closing during the period as expected primarily as a result of prospective customers delaying their purchase decisions in anticipation of the introduction and general availability of advanced compression technologies revenue from the sale of our broadband transport and service management products decreased by to million in from million in cost of goods sold for the year ended december our cost of goods sold increased by or million to million from million for the year ended december included in cost of goods are the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories these reserves were primarily related to lower of cost or market adjustments for raw materials and reserves for finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future during both and cost of goods sold included a charge for increases in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million these charges were primarily associated with our video processing systems products the increase in cost of goods sold of million from to included increases in materials costs of million outside contractor expenses of million and amortization of million also included in cost of goods sold during was a one time charge of million to amortize the backlog acquired in the copper mountain acquisition our gross profit increased in compared to due to increased sales volume from our video processing systems for the year ended december our cost of goods sold increased by or million to million from million for the year ended december included in cost of goods are the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories these reserves were primarily related to lower of cost or market adjustments for raw materials and reserves for finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future during cost of goods sold included a charge for an increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million this charge was primarily associated with our video processing systems products in cost of goods sold was reduced as a result of a decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million the decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories in was because we were able to sell certain products for which we had originally set aside reserves in prior years in addition to this million increase included in costs of goods from the change in reserves for excess and obsolete inventories from to other significant increases in cost of goods sold table of contents included increases in labor expenses of million outside contractor expenses of million freight costs of million and amortization expenses of million partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in materials cost of million our gross profit declined in compared to due to decreased sales volume for both our video processing systems and our broadband transport and service management products the cost increases previously mentioned including the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories also negatively affected our gross profit in when compared to sales and marketing for the year ended december our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december the increase of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million due to additional headcount added during the year and additional headcount from our acquisition of copper mountain million for travel costs million for promotional and advertising costs million for purchases of supplies and million for depreciation of equipment for the year ended december our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december the increase of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million due to additional headcount added during the year million for promotional and advertising costs million for facilities and infrastructure expenses and million in outside services expenses research and development for the year ended december our research and development expense increased by to million from million for the year ended december the million increase in our research and development expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million from additional headcount added from our acquisition of copper mountain million from outside services million for facility costs million for the purchase of supplies relating to the development of our new product offerings and million for travel costs our capital expenditures for research and development were million in million in and million for for the year ended december our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december the million decrease in our research and development expense was due to a year over year decrease in personnel related costs general and administrative for the year ended december our general and administrative expense increased by to million from million for the year ended december the million increase in our general and administrative expense was primarily due to a million one time write off of costs relating to cosines termination of the proposed merger offset by a decrease in outside services of million and franchise taxes of million for the year ended december our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december the million decrease in our general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of million lower insurance costs of million and contractors cost of million offset by higher relocation costs of million and outside service costs of million restructuring costs in september we announced a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction as a result of this restructuring program we recorded restructuring costs of million consisting of severance payments as of december we have paid all of the costs relating to the restructuring we did not incur any restructuring costs for the year ended december we incurred restructuring costs of million for the year ended december in august we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction and relocation this restructuring program resulted in restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of table of contents the restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges related primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million in relocation expenses as a result of this restructuring we reduced our workforce by approximately impairment of assets during the third quarter of we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the vtc acquisition had become impaired as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology during the fourth quarter of we determined that certain assets in our uk office had become impaired as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the assets during the first quarter of we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the purchase of the viagate technology assets had become impaired as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology during the second quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of certain technology acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets of viagate the impairment costs have been included in cost of goods sold amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is comprised of intangibles related to the acquisitions of freegate oneworld assets and xstreamis in activetelco in vtc in and copper mountain in the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization from these acquisitions consist primarily of completed technology and patents amortization expense was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively amortization expense included in cost of goods sold was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively the million increase in when compared with was the result of intangible assets acquired as part of the copper mountain acquisition the million decrease in when compared with was the result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized in gain on sale of investments the gain on sale of investments for the year ended december resulted from the sale of certain equity investments that had been written down to zero in a previous year interest and other income net interest and other income net consists primarily of interest income and expense interest and other income net remained consistent at million and million for the years ended december and respectively for the year ended december our interest and other income net decreased to an expense of million from an income of for the year ended december the decrease was due to interest expense associated with the million note issued in connection with our purchase of vtc in november liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at december reflecting a net reduction in cash and cash equivalents of million cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december compared with million for the year ended december the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss in compared with and a higher accounts receivable and inventory balance which was partially offset by higher accounts payable balances in compared with the same period in cash used in investing activities included additions to property and equipment for the year ended december of million compared with million in and net cash acquired as part of the copper mountain acquisition of million offset by net purchases of short term investments of million in we expect capital expenditures to increase compared with we expect these capital expenditures to be funded from operations and borrowings from our existing credit facility table of contents cash provided by financing activities in consisted of million from the issuance of private equity financing million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan and net proceeds from the line of credit of million the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december resulted primarily from our use of million for operating activities and the purchase of property and equipment of million the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents from these uses was offset by million from the issuance of million additional common shares in a secondary offering and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan off balance sheet arrangements as of december we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations thousands total less than year years years thereafter line of credit long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capital lease commitments operating lease commitments purchase obligations total on september we entered into a revolving asset based credit facility credit facility with silicon valley bank the bank which was amended on december as amended this facility had an initial term of two years and expires on september borrowings under the credit facility are formula based and limited to the lesser of million or an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is equal to the banks prime rate as of december plus the rate may increase by if we do not meet certain financial covenants all of our assets are pledged as collateral and the credit facility contains various covenants we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december based on the maximum percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory levels available borrowings under this facility were million as of december in addition this credit facility allows for long term borrowings of up to million for purchase of fixed assets we had outstanding borrowings of against the revolving credit facility and no long term borrowings against the credit facility at december as part of our acquisition of vtc from tektronix in november we issued a note payable to tektronix for million with repayment in sixty months or by november the interest rate on this note is and is compounded annually through january the accrued interest is added to the principal balance of the note thereafter we will pay accrued interest on this note commencing on january and on each table of contents april july and october thereafter until the principal balance is paid in full principal and accrued interest on the note payable is million at december in july we completed the sale of shares of our common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million net proceeds from the offering were approximately million under the terms of the sale we also issued warrants to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock the warrants expire in and beginning in are exercisable at a per share price of we also have the right to call the warrants in the event that the trading price of our common stock exceeds per share for twenty consecutive trading days if exercised in full the warrants would provide us an additional million in cash we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception for the year ended december we incurred a net loss of million negative cash flows from operating activities of million and have an accumulated deficit of million we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facility as of december are sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months in future periods we generally anticipate that our cash flows from operations will begin to increase as a result of several factors including our expectation that our revenue will increase and our net loss will decrease in as compared to accordingly we expect the amount of cash used to fund our operations to decrease in however in the event that we do not meet our revenue and earnings expectations we may require additional cash to fund our operations failure to generate positive cash flow in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products including third party products through professional services and through the sale of our software products we sell products through direct sales channels and through distributors generally revenue is generated from the sale of video processing systems and components and the sale of broadband transport and service management products revenue is generated primarily from the sale of complete end to end video processing systems generally referred to as turnkey solutions turnkey solution revenue is principally generated by the sale of complete end to end video processing systems that are designed developed and produced according to a buyers specifications turnkey solutions are multi element arrangements which consist of hardware products software products professional services and post contract support revenue is also generated from the sale of video processing component products and the sale of broadband transport and service management products and the sale of certain legacy products related to the acquisition of copper mountain we sell these products through our own direct sales channels and also through distributors table of contents our revenue recognition policies for turnkey solutions are in accordance with sop software revenue recognition as amended which is the authoritative guidance for recognizing revenue on software transactions and transactions in which software is more than incidental to the arrangement sop requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements such as hardware software products maintenance services installation training or other elements under sop the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor if such evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop as amended sop was amended in february by sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop and was amended again in december by sop modification of sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions those amendments deferred and then clarified respectively the specification of what was considered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement in the case of software arrangements that require significant production modification or customization of software which encompasses all of our turnkey arrangements sop refers to the guidance in sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts we recognize revenue for all turnkey arrangements in accordance with sop and sop excluding the pcs element of the multi element arrangement for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value as defined by sop revenue from turnkey solutions is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method as stipulated by sop the percentage of completion method reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned that is equal to the ratio of labor effort expended to date to the anticipated final labor effort based on current estimates of total labor effort necessary to complete the project revenue from the pcs element of the arrangement is deferred at the point of sale and recognized over the term of the pcs period generally the terms of the turnkey solution sales provide for billing of approximately of the contract value prior to the time of delivery to the customer site with an additional approximately of the contract value billed upon substantial completion of the project and the balance upon customer acceptance in connection with certain contracts we may perform the work prior to when the revenue is billable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue the contractual arrangements relative to turnkey solutions include customer acceptance provisions however such provisions are generally considered to be incidental to the arrangement in its entirety because customers are fully obligated with respect to approximately of the contract value irrespective of whether acceptance occurs or not for direct sales of video processing systems component products not included as part of turnkey solutions and the direct sale of broadband transport products and service management products and the sales of legacy products related to the acquisition of copper mountain we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition at the time of the transaction we assess a number of factors including specific contract and purchase order terms completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier past transaction history with the customer the creditworthiness of the customer evidence of sell through to the end user and current payment terms based on the results of the assessment we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition of revenue until evidence of sell through occurs and cash is received in order to recognize revenue table of contents we must also make a judgment regarding collectibility managements judgment of collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy we sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection and to new customers for which such history may not exist new customers are subject to a credit review process which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay new customers are typically assigned a credit limit based on a review of their financial position such credit limits are only increased after a successful collection history with the customer has been established if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process no credit is extended and revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs as necessary estimated sales returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized as necessary our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase to date warranty costs have been insignificant to the overall financial statements taken as a whole unbilled receivables unbilled receivables costs and estimated profit in excess of billings may be recorded in connection with certain turnkey solution contracts unbilled receivables are not billable at the balance sheet date but are recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis we record provisions to write down our inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the future demand and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate additional inventory provisions may be required recent accounting pronouncements in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no r revised share based payment which amends fasb statement no and will be effective for public companies for first fiscal years beginning after june we will adopt sfas r on january on a prospective basis the new standard will require us to expense employee stock options and other share based payments the fasb believes the use of a binomial lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the black scholes options pricing model the new standard may be adopted in one of three ways the modified prospective transition method a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method we will adopt sfas no r using the black scholes options pricing model under the modified prospective transition method on december the board of directors of approved full acceleration of unvested stock options with an exercise price of or greater previously granted under our stock option plan and non statutory stock option plan held our officers and employees options to purchase approximately shares of the companys common stock including approximately shares held by our named executive officers are subject to acceleration effective as of december since we currently account for share based payments using the intrinsic value method under apb we expect the adoption of sfas r will have an adverse impact on our results of operations on march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin or sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the secs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies in particular sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees the transition from nonpublic to public entity status valuation methods including assumptions such as expected table of contents volatility and expected term the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements the classification of compensation expense non gaap financial measures first time adoption of sfas no r in an interim period capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no r the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas no r and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas no r we are currently evaluating the impact that sab will have on our results of operations when we adopt it in fiscal in june the fasb issued fas no accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no and fas no which replaces apb opinion no accounting changes and fasb statement no reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable this statement also requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in november the fasb issued sfas no inventory costs an amendment of arb no chapter sfas sfas amends the previously issued authoritative guidance to clarify those abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges in addition sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june and will be adopted by us beginning january we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in november fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired whether that impairment is other than temporary and on measuring such impairment loss fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december the adoption of fsp will not have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december we had million in short term investments an immediate change in interest rate would be immaterial to

date the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue has not been material as the majority of our revenue is earned in us dollars an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce demand for our product for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using the period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses to us dollars using average exchange rates during the period foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are reported as a separate component on our statement of stockholders equity to date the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on translation has not been material table of contents
